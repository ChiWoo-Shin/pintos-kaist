to KAIST CS330's Pintos project.\nIn this semester, we will use modified version of the pintos that is specially\ntailored for KAIST's CS330 class.\nPlease notice that since the requirements are somewhat differed from the\nvanilla one, YOU SHOULD FOLLOW THE INSTRUCTION OF THIS MANUAL FIRST.\nAlso, you can refer the YOUR OWN previous pintos project, but you need to\nreimplemented some of the requirements according to the updated one.\nAll the changes lead instructors to modify the manual. Although instructors\ntried to synchronize the manual with modified version, there may exist\nunsynchronized sections. If you find them, please notice to instructors.\nYOU MUST READ\nLegal and Ethical Issues SECTION.\nThe pintos-kaist is a simple operating system framework for the x86-64\narchitecture. This project forked from the pintos project from the stanford\nuniversity. Pintos (we will use Pintos rather than pintos-kaist from now)\nsupports kernel threads, loading and running user programs,\nand a file system, but it implements all of these in a very simple way. In the\nPintos projects, you and your project team will strengthen its support in all\nthree of these areas. You will also add a virtual memory implementation. Pintos\ncould, theoretically, run on a regular x86-64 PC. Unfortunately, it is\nimpractical to supply every CS330 student a dedicated PC for use with Pintos.\nTherefore, we will run Pintos projects in a system simulator, that is, a program\nthat simulates an x86-64 CPU and its peripheral devices accurately enough that\nunmodified operating systems and software can run under it. In class we will use\nthe QEMU simulators. These projects are hard. CS330 has a reputation of\ntaking a lot of time, and deservedly so. We will do what we can to reduce the\nworkload, such as providing a lot of support material, but there is plenty of\nhard work that needs to be done. We welcome your feedback. If you have\nsuggestions on how we can reduce the unnecessary overhead of assignments,\ncutting them down to the important underlying issues, please let us know. This\nchapter explains how to get started working with Pintos. You should read the\nentire chapter before you start work on any of the projects.\n"},"introduction/getting_started.html":{"url":"introduction/getting_started.html","title":"Getting Started","keywords":"","body":"Getting Started\nTo get started, you'll have to log into a machine that Pintos can be built on.\nYou may use given Linux machines by the intructors or your own Solaris or Linux\nmachines. However, we will test your code on given machines, and the\ninstructions given here assume this environment. We cannot provide support for\ninstalling and working on Pintos on your own machine. Belows server environment\nwill be given to each student.\nNow you can get the source code for Pintos into a directory name 'pintos',\nby executing:\ngit clone https://github.com/casys-kaist/pintos-kaist\n\nHowever, the source codes are likely to be changed before the project\nperiod, we recommend you to duplicate the\nrepository.\nWhen we change the template code, you can\neasily synchronize\nyour code with the template. Please NOT TO MAKE PUBLIC FORK.\nWe will never change the source code during the project period, except\nfor the critical bug lies on the template code.\nFYI. We have tested the pintos code and the solution on the Ubuntu 16.04.6 LTS\nwith gcc (gcc (Ubuntu 7.4.0-1ubuntu1~16.04~ppa1) 7.4.0) and qemu-system-x86_64\n(QEMU emulator version 2.5.0 (Debian 1:2.5+dfsg-5ubuntu10.43)), same as the\ngiven linux machine.\nOnce you've retrived source code, you can set up your environment with below\ncommand in pintos root directory:\n$ source ./activate\n\nIt is a good idea to add this line to the '.bashrc' in your home directory.\nOtherwise, you'll have to type it every time you log in.\nSource Tree Overview\nLet's take a look at what's inside. Here's the directory structure that you\nshould see in pintos/\n\nthreads/: Source code for the base kernel, which you will modify starting in\nproject 1.\nuserprog/: Source code for the user program loader, which you will modify\nstarting with project 2.\nvm/: An almost empty directory. You will implement virtual memory here in\nproject 3.\nfilesys/: Source code for a basic file system. You will use this file system\nstarting with project 2, but you will not modify it until project 4.\ndevices/: Source code for I/O device interfacing: keyboard, timer, disk,\netc. You will modify the timer implementation in project 1. Otherwise you\nshould have no need to change this code.\nlib/: An implementation of a subset of the standard C library. The code in\nthis directory is compiled into both the Pintos kernel and, starting from\nproject 2, user programs that run under it. You should have little need to\nmodify this code.\ninclude/lib/kernel/: Parts of the C library that are included only in the\nPintos kernel. This also includes implementations of some data types that you\nare free to use in your kernel code: bitmaps, doubly linked lists, and\nhash tables. In the kernel, headers in this directory can be included using\nthe #include  notation.\ninclude/lib/user/: Parts of the C library that are included only in Pintos\nuser programs. In user programs, headers in this directory can be included\nusing the #include  notation.\ntests/: Tests for each project. You can modify this code if it helps you\ntest your submission, but we will replace it with the originals before we run\nthe tests.\nexamples/: Example user programs for use starting with project 2.\ninclude/: Source code for the header files (*.h).\n\nBuilding Pintos\nAs the next step, build the source code supplied for the first project. First,\ncd into the threads directory. Then, issue the make command.\nThis will create a build directory under threads, populate it with a\nMakefile and a few subdirectories, and then build the kernel inside.\nFollowing the build, the following are the interesting files in the build\ndirectory:\n\nMakefile: A copy of pintos/src/Makefile.build. It describes how to build\nthe kernel.\nkernel.o: Object file for the entire kernel. This is the result of linking\nobject files compiled from each individual kernel source file into a single\nobject file. It contains debug information, so you can run GDB\n(see GDB) or backtrace\n(Backtraces) on it.\nkernel.bin: Memory image of the kernel, that is, the exact bytes loaded into\nmemory to run the Pintos kernel. This is just kernel.o with debug\ninformation stripped out, which saves a lot of space, which in turn keeps the\nkernel from bumping up against a 512 kB size limit imposed by the kernel\nloader's design.\nloader.bin: Memory image for the kernel loader, a small chunk of code\nwritten in assembly language that reads the kernel from disk into memory and\nstarts it up. It is exactly 512 bytes long, a size fixed by the PC BIOS.\nSubdirectories of build contain object files (.o) and dependency files\n(.d), both produced by the compiler. The dependency files tell make which\nsource files need to be recompiled when other source or header files are\nchanged.\n\nRunning Pintos\nWe've supplied a program for conveniently running Pintos in a simulator, called\npintos. In the simplest case, you can invoke pintos as pintos argument....\nEach argument is passed to the Pintos kernel for it to act on.\nTry it out. First cd into the newly created build directory. Then issue the\ncommand pintos run alarm-multiple, which passes the arguments run alarm-multiple\nto the Pintos kernel. In these arguments, run instructs the kernel to run a test\nand alarm-multiple is the test to run. Pintos boots and runs the alarm-multiple\ntest program, which outputs a few screenfuls of text.\nYou can log serial output to a file by redirecting at the command line,\ne.g. pintos -- run alarm-multiple > logfile. The pintos program offers several\noptions for configuring the qemu or the virtual hardware. If you specify any\noptions, they must precede the commands passed to the Pintos kernel and be\nseparated from them by --, so that the whole command looks like\npintos option... -- argument.... Invoke pintos without any arguments to see a\nlist of available options. Options includes: how you want VM output to be\ndisplayed: use -v to turn off the VGA display, or -s to suppress serial\ninput from stdin and output to stdout. The Pintos kernel has commands and\noptions other than run. These are not very interesting for now, but you can see\na list of them using -h, e.g. pintos -h.\n"},"introduction/grading.html":{"url":"introduction/grading.html","title":"Grading","keywords":"","body":"Grading\nWe will grade your assignments based on test results.\nTesting\nYour test result grade will be based on our tests.\nEach project has several tests, each of which has a name beginning with tests.\nTo completely test your submission, invoke make check from the project build\ndirectory. This will build and run each test and print a pass or fail\nmessage for each one. When a test fails, make check also prints some details\nof the reason for failure. After running all the tests, make check also prints a\nsummary of the test results.\nYou can also run individual tests one at a time. A given test t writes its\noutput to t.output, then a script scores the output as pass or fail and\nwrites the verdict to t.result. To run and grade a single test, make the\n.result file explicitly from the build directory, e.g.\nmake tests/threads/alarm-multiple.result. If make says that the test result is\nup-to-date, but you want to re-run it anyway, either run make clean or delete\nthe .output file by hand. By default, each test provides feedback only at\ncompletion, not during its run.

Your job\nis to extend the functionality of this system to gain a better understanding of\nsynchronization problems. You will be working primarily in the threads\ndirectory for this assignment, with some work in the devices directory on the\nside. Compilation should be done in the threads directory.\nBefore you read the description of this project, you should at least skim the\nmaterial Synchronization.\nBackground\nUnderstanding Threads\nThe first step is to read and understand the code for the initial thread system.\nPintos already implements thread creation and thread completion, a simple\nscheduler to switch between threads, and synchronization primitives\n(semaphores, locks, condition variables, and optimization barriers).\nSome of this code might seem slightly mysterious. If you haven't already\ncompiled and run the base system, as described in the\nintroduction you should do so now.\nYou can read through parts of the source code to see what's going on. If you\nlike, you can add calls to printf() almost anywhere, then recompile and run to\nsee what happens and in what order. You can also run the kernel in a debugger\nand set breakpoints at interesting spots, single-step through code and examine\ndata, and so on.\nWhen a thread is created, you are creating a new context to be scheduled. You\nprovide a function to be run in this context as an argument to thread_create().\nThe first time the thread is scheduled and runs, it starts from the beginning of\nthat function and executes in that context. When the function returns, the\nthread terminates. Each thread, therefore, acts like a mini-program running\ninside Pintos, with the function passed to thread_create() acting like\nmain().\nAt any given time, exactly one thread runs and the rest, if any, become\ninactive. The scheduler decides which thread to run next. (If no thread is ready\nto run at any given time, then the special idle thread, implemented in\nidle(), runs.) Synchronization primitives can force context switches when one\nthread needs to wait for another thread to do something.\nThe mechanics of a context switch are in thread_launch() in threads/thread.c\n(You don't have to understand it.) It saves the state of the currently\nrunning thread and restores the state of the thread we're switching to.\nUsing the GDB debugger, slowly trace through a context switch to see what\nhappens (see GDB). You can set a breakpoint on schedule() to start out,\nand then single-step from there. Be sure to keep track of each thread's address\nand state, and what procedures are on the call stack for each thread. You will\nnotice that when one thread executes iret in do_iret(), another thread\nstarts running.\nWarning: In Pintos, each thread is assigned a small, fixed-size execution\nstack just under 4 kB in size. The kernel tries to detect stack overflow, but it\ncannot do so perfectly. You may cause bizarre problems, such as mysterious\nkernel panics, if you declare large data structures as non-static local\nvariables, e.g. int buf[1000];. Alternatives to stack allocation include\nthe page allocator and the block allocator (see Memory\nAllocation.)\nSource Files\nHere is a brief overview of the files in the threads, and include/threads\ndirectory. You will not need to modify most of this code, but the hope is that\npresenting this overview will give you a start on what code to look at.\nthreads codes\n\nloader.S, loader.h\nThe kernel loader. Assembles to 512 bytes of code and data that the PC BIOS\nloads into memory and which in turn finds the kernel on disk, loads it into\nmemory, and jumps to bootstrap() in start.S. You should not need to look\nat this code or modify it. start.S does basic setup needed for memory\nprotection and jump into the 64bit long mode. Unlike the loader, this code is\nactually part of the kernel.\n\nkernel.lds.S\nThe linker script used to link the kernel. Sets the load address of the kernel\nand arranges for start.S to be near the beginning of the kernel image.\nAgain, you should not need to look at this code or modify it, but it's here in\ncase you're curious.\n\ninit.c, init.h\nKernel initialization, including main(), the kernel's main program. You\nshould look over main() at least to see what gets initialized. You might\nwant to add your own initialization code here.\n\nthread.c, thread.h\nBasic thread support. Much of your work will take place in these files.\nthread.h defines struct thread, which you are likely to modify in all four\nprojects. See Threads for more information.\n\npalloc.c, palloc.h\nPage allocator, which hands out system memory in multiples of 4 kB pages.\nSee Page Allocator for more\ninformation.\n\nmalloc.c, malloc.h\nA simple implementation of malloc() and free() for the kernel. See\nBlock Allocator for more\ninformation.\n\ninterrupt.c, interrupt.h\nBasic interrupt handling and functions for turning interrupts on and off.\n\nintr-stubs.S, intr-stubs.h\nAssembly code for low-level interrupt handling.\n\nsynch.c, synch.h\nBasic synchronization primitives: semaphores, locks, condition variables, and\noptimization barriers. You will need to use these for synchronization in all\nfour projects. See Synchronization for more\ninformation.\n\nmmu.c, mmu.h\nFunctions for x86-64 page table operations. You will look this file closer\nafter the lab1.\n\nio.h\nFunctions for I/O port access. This is mostly used by source code in the\ndevices directory that you won't have to touch.\n\nvaddr.h, pte.h\nFunctions and macros for working with virtual addresses and page table\nentries. These will be more important to you in project 3. For now, you can\nignore them.\n\nflags.h\nMacros that define a few bits in the x86-64 flags register. Probably of no\ninterest.\n\n\ndevices codes\nThe basic threaded kernel also includes these files in the devices directory:\n\ntimer.c, timer.h\nSystem timer that ticks, by default, 100 times per second. You will modify\nthis code in this project.\n\nvga.c, vga.h\nVGA display driver. Responsible for writing text to the screen. You should\nhave no need to look at this code. printf() calls into the VGA display\ndriver for you, so there's little reason to call this code yourself.\n\nserial.c, serial.h\nSerial port driver. Again, printf() calls this code for you, so you don't\nneed to do so yourself. It handles serial input by passing it to the input\nlayer (see below).\n\nblock.c, block.h\nAn abstraction layer for block devices, that is, random-access, disk-like\ndevices that are organized as arrays of fixed-size blocks. Out of the box,\nPintos supports two types of block devices: IDE disks and partitions. Block\ndevices, regardless of type, won't actually be used until project 2.\n\nide.c, ide.h\nSupports reading and writing sectors on up to 4 IDE disks.\n\npartition.c, partition.h\nUnderstands the structure of partitions on disks, allowing a single disk to be\ncarved up into multiple regions (partitions) for independent use.\n\nkbd.c, kbd.h\nKeyboard driver. Handles keystrokes passing them to the input layer\n(see below).\n\ninput.c, input.h\nInput layer. Queues input characters passed along by the keyboard or serial\ndrivers.\n\nintq.c, intq.h\nInterrupt queue, for managing a circular queue that both kernel threads and\ninterrupt handlers want to access. Used by the keyboard and serial drivers.\n\nrtc.c, rtc.h\nReal-time clock driver, to enable the kernel to determine the current date and\ntime. By default, this is only used by thread/init.c to choose an initial\nseed for the random number generator.\n\nspeaker.c, speaker.h\nDriver that can produce tones on the PC speaker.\n\npit.c, pit.h\nCode to configure the 8254 Programmable Interrupt Timer. This code is used\nby both devices/timer.c and devices/speaker.c because each device uses\none of the PIT's output channel.\n\n\nlib codes\nFinally, lib and lib/kernel contain useful library routines. (lib/user\nwill be used by user programs, starting in project 2, but it is not part of the\nkernel.) Here's a few more details:\n\nctype.h, inttypes.h, limits.h, stdarg.h, stdbool.h, stddef.h,\nstdint.h, stdio.c, stdio.h, stdlib.c, stdlib.h, string.c,\nstring.h\nA subset of the standard C library.\n\ndebug.c, debug.h\nFunctions and macros to aid debugging. See Debugging Tools for more\ninformation.\n\nrandom.c, random.h\nPseudo-random number generator. The actual sequence of random values will\nnot vary from one Pintos run to another.\n\nround.h\nMacros for rounding.\n\nsyscall-nr.h\nSystem call numbers. Not used until project 2.\n\nkernel/list.c, kernel/list.h\nDoubly linked list implementation. Used all over the Pintos code, and you'll\nprobably want to use it a few places yourself in project 1. We recommand you\nto skim this code before you start (especially comments in the header file.)\n\nkernel/bitmap.c, kernel/bitmap.h\nBitmap implementation. You can use this in your code if you like, but you\nprobably won't have any need for it in project 1.\n\nkernel/hash.c, kernel/hash.h\nHash table implementation. Likely to come in handy for project 3.\n\nkernel/console.c, kernel/console.h, kernel/stdio.h\nImplements printf() and a few other functions.\n\n\nSynchronization\nProper synchronization is an important part of the solutions to these problems.\nAny synchronization problem can be easily solved by turning interrupts off:\nwhile interrupts are off, there is no concurrency, so there's no possibility for\nrace conditions. Therefore, it's tempting to solve all synchronization problems\nthis way, but don't. Instead, use semaphores, locks, and condition variables to\nsolve the bulk of your synchronization problems. Read the tour section on\nsynchronization (see Synchronization) or the\ncomments in threads/synch.c if you're unsure what synchronization primitives\nmay be used in what situations.\nIn the Pintos projects, the only class of problem best solved by disabling\ninterrupts is coordinating data shared between a kernel thread and an interrupt\nhandler. Because interrupt handlers can't sleep, they can't acquire locks.\nThis means that data shared between kernel threads and an interrupt handler must\nbe protected within a kernel thread by turning off interrupts.\nThis project only requires accessing a little bit of thread state from\ninterrupt handlers. For the alarm clock, the timer interrupt needs to wake up\nsleeping threads. In the advanced scheduler, the timer interrupt needs to access\na few global and per-thread variables. When you access these variables from\nkernel threads, you will need to disable interrupts to prevent the timer\ninterrupt from interfering.\nWhen you do turn off interrupts, take care to do so for the least amount of code\npossible, or you can end up losing important things such as timer ticks or input\nevents. Turning off interrupts also increases the interrupt handling latency,\nwhich can make a machine feel sluggish if taken too far.\nThe synchronization primitives themselves in synch.c are implemented by\ndisabling interrupts. You may need to increase the amount of code that runs with\ninterrupts disabled here, but you should still try to keep it to a minimum.\nDisabling interrupts can be useful for debugging, if you want to make sure that\na section of code is not interrupted. You should remove debugging code before\nturning in your project. (Don't just comment it out, because that can make the\ncode difficult to read.)\nThere should be no busy waiting in your submission. A tight loop that calls\nthread_yield() is one form of busy waiting.\nDevelopment Suggestions\nIn the past, many groups divided the assignment into pieces, then each group\nmember worked on his or her piece until just before the deadline, at which time\nthe group reconvened to combine their code and submit. This is a bad idea. We do\nnot recommend this approach. Groups that do this often find that two changes\nconflict with each other, requiring lots of last-minute debugging. Some groups\nwho have done this have turned in code that did not even compile or boot,\nmuch less pass any tests.\nInstead, we recommend integrating your team's changes early and often, using a\nsource code control system such as git.\nThis is less likely to produce surprises, because everyone can see everyone\nelse's code as it is written, instead of just when it is finished. These systems\nalso make it possible to review changes and, when a change introduces a bug,\ndrop back to working versions of code.\nYou should expect to run into bugs that you simply don't understand while\nworking on this and subsequent projects. When you do, reread the appendix on\ndebugging tools, which is filled with useful debugging tips that should help you\nto get back up to speed (see Debugging Tools). Be sure to read the section\non backtraces (see Backtraces), which will help you to get the most out of\nevery kernel panic or assertion failure.\n"},"project1/alarm_clock.html":{"url":"project1/alarm_clock.html","title":"Alarm Clock","keywords":"","body":"Alarm Clock\nReimplement timer_sleep(), defined in devices/timer.c.\nAlthough a working implementation is provided, it busy waits, that is,\nit spins in a loop checking the current time and calling thread_yield() until\nenough time has gone by.

Similarly, when threads are waiting for a lock,\nsemaphore, or condition variable, the highest priority waiting thread should be\nawakened first. A thread may raise or lower its own priority at any time,\nbut lowering its priority such that it no longer has the highest priority must\ncause it to immediately yield the CPU.\nThread priorities range from PRI_MIN (0) to PRI_MAX (63). Lower numbers\ncorrespond to lower priorities, so that priority 0 is the lowest priority and\npriority 63 is the highest. The initial thread priority is passed as an argument\nto thread_create(). If there's no reason to choose another priority, use\nPRI_DEFAULT (31). The PRI_ macros are defined in threads/thread.h, and you\nshould not change their values.\nOne issue with priority scheduling is \"priority inversion\". Consider high,\nmedium, and low priority threads H, M, and L, respectively. If H needs\nto wait for L (for instance, for a lock held by L), and M is on the ready\nlist, then H will never get the CPU because the low priority thread will not\nget any CPU time. A partial fix for this problem is for H to \"donate\" its\npriority to L while L is holding the lock, then recall the donation once L\nreleases (and thus H acquires) the lock.\nImplement priority donation. You will need to account for all different\nsituations in which priority donation is required. Be sure to handle multiple\ndonations, in which multiple priorities are donated to a single thread. You must\nalso handle nested donation: if H is waiting on a lock that M holds and M\nis waiting on a lock that L holds, then both M and L should be boosted to\nH's priority. If necessary, you may impose a reasonable limit on depth of\nnested priority donation, such as 8 levels.\nYou must implement priority donation for locks. You need not implement priority\ndonation for the other Pintos synchronization constructs. You do need to\nimplement priority scheduling in all cases.\nFinally, implement the following functions that allow a thread to examine and\nmodify its own priority. Skeletons for these functions are provided in\nthreads/thread.c.\n\nvoid thread_set_priority (int new_priority);\n\n\nSets the current thread's priority to new priority. If the current thread no\nlonger has the highest priority, yields.\n\n\nint thread_get_priority (void);\n\n\nReturns the current thread's priority. In the presence of priority donation,\nreturns the higher (donated) priority.\n\nYou need not provide any interface to allow a thread to directly modify other\nthreads' priorities.\nThe priority scheduler is not used in any later project.\n"},"project1/advanced_scheduler.html":{"url":"project1/advanced_scheduler.html","title":"Advanced Scheduler","keywords":"","body":"Advanced Scheduler\nImplement a multilevel feedback queue scheduler similar to the\n4.4BSD scheduler to reduce the average response time for\nrunning jobs on your system.\nLike the priority scheduler, the advanced scheduler chooses the thread to run\nbased on priorities. However, the advanced scheduler does not do priority\ndonation. Thus, we recommend that you have the priority scheduler working,\nexcept possibly for priority donation, before you start work on the advanced\nscheduler.\nYou must write your code to allow us to choose a scheduling algorithm policy at\nPintos startup time. By default, the priority scheduler must be active, but we\nmust be able to choose the 4.4BSD scheduler with the -mlfqs kernel option.\nPassing this option sets thread_mlfqs, declared in threads/thread.h, to true\nwhen the options are parsed by parse_options(), which happens early in\nmain().\nWhen the 4.4BSD scheduler is enabled, threads no longer directly control their\nown priorities. The priority argument to thread_create() should be ignored,\nas well as any calls to thread_set_priority(), and thread_get_priority()\nshould return the thread's current priority as set by the scheduler. The\nadvanced scheduler is not used in any later project.\n4.4BSD Scheduler\nThe goal of a general-purpose scheduler is to balance threads' different\nscheduling needs. Threads that perform a lot of I/O require a fast response time\nto keep input and output devices busy, but need little CPU time. On the other\nhand, compute-bound threads need to receive a lot of CPU time to finish their\nwork, but have no requirement for fast response time. Other threads lie\nsomewhere in between, with periods of I/O punctuated by periods of computation,\nand thus have requirements that vary over time. A well-designed scheduler\ncan often accommodate threads with all these requirements simultaneously.\nFor project 1, you must implement the scheduler described in this appendix. Our\nscheduler resembles the one described in [McKusick], which is one example of a\nmultilevel feedback queue scheduler. This type of scheduler maintains several\nqueues of ready-to-run threads, where each queue holds threads with a different\npriority. At any given time, the scheduler chooses a thread from the\nhighest-priority non-empty queue. If the highest-priority queue contains\nmultiple threads, then they run in \"round robin\" order.\nMultiple facets of the scheduler require data to be updated after a certain\nnumber of timer ticks. In every case, these updates should occur before any\nordinary kernel thread has a chance to run, so that there is no chance that a\nkernel thread could see a newly increased timer_ticks() value but old\nscheduler data values.\nThe 4.4BSD scheduler does not include priority donation.\nNiceness\nThread priority is dynamically determined by the scheduler using a formula given\nbelow. However, each thread also has an integer nice value that determines how\n\"nice\" the thread should be to other threads. A nice of zero does not affect\nthread priority. A positive nice, to the maximum of 20, decreases the priority\nof a thread and causes it to give up some CPU time it would otherwise receive.\nOn the other hand, a negative nice, to the minimum of -20, tends to take away\nCPU time from other threads.\nThe initial thread starts with a nice value of zero. Other threads start with a\nnice value inherited from their parent thread. You must implement the functions\ndescribed below, which are for use by test programs. We have provided skeleton\ndefinitions for them in threads/thread.c\nint thread_get_nice (void);\n\n\nReturns the current thread's nice value.\n\nint thread_set_nice (int nice);\n\n\nSets the current thread's nice value to new nice and recalculates the thread's\npriority based on the new value\n(see Calculating Priority). If the running thread no\nlonger has the highest priority, yields.\n\nCalculating Priority\nOur scheduler has 64 priorities and thus 64 ready queues, numbered 0 (PRI_MIN)\nthrough 63 (PRI_MAX). Lower numbers correspond to lower priorities, so that\npriority 0 is the lowest priority and priority 63 is the highest. Thread\npriority is calculated initially at thread initialization. It is also\nrecalculated once every fourth clock tick, for every thread. In either\ncase, it is determined by the formula:\n\npriority = PRI_MAX - (recent_cpu / 4) - (nice * 2),\n\nwhere recent cpu is an estimate of the CPU time the thread has used recently\n(see below) and nice is the thread's nice value. The result should be rounded\ndown to the nearest integer (truncated). The coefficients 1/4 and 2 on recent\ncpu and nice, respectively, have been found to work well in practice but lack\ndeeper meaning. The calculated priority is always adjusted to lie in the valid\nrange PRI_MIN to PRI_MAX.\nThis formula gives a thread that has received CPU time recently lower priority\nfor being reassigned the CPU the next time the scheduler runs. This is key to\npreventing starvation: a thread that has not received any CPU time recently will\nhave a recent cpu of 0, which barring a high nice value should ensure that it\nreceives CPU time soon.\nCalculating recent_cpu\nWe wish recent cpu to measure how much CPU time each process has received\n\"recently.\" Furthermore, as a refinement, more recent CPU time should be\nweighted more heavily than less recent CPU time. One approach would use an array\nof n elements to track the CPU time received in each of the last n seconds.\nHowever, this approach requires O(n) space per thread and O(n) time per\ncalculation of a new weighted average.\nInstead, we use a exponentially weighted moving average, which takes this\ngeneral form:\n\nx(0) = f(0),\nx(t) = ax(t − 1) + (1 − a)f(t),\na = k/(k + 1),\n\nwhere x(t) is the moving average at integer time t ≥ 0, f(t) is the\nfunction being averaged, and k > 0 controls the rate of decay. We can iterate\nthe formula over a few steps as follows:\n\nx(1) = f(1),\nx(2) = af(1) + f(2),\n...\nx(5) = a^4 * f(1) + a^3 * f(2) + a^2 * f(3) + a * f(4) + f(5).\n\nThe value of f(t) has a weight of 1 at time t, a weight of a at time\nt + 1, a^2 at time t + 2, and so on. We can also relate x(t) to k:\nf(t) has a weight of approximately 1/e at time t + k, approximately\n1/(e^2) at time t + 2k, and so on. From the opposite direction, f(t)\ndecays to weight w at time t + log_a(w).\nThe initial value of recent_cpu is 0 in the first thread created, or the\nparent's value in other new threads. Each time a timer interrupt occurs,\nrecent_cpu is incremented by 1 for the running thread only, unless the idle\nthread is running. In addition, once per second the value of recent cpu is\nrecalculated for every thread (whether running, ready, or blocked), using this\nformula:\n\nrecent_cpu = (2 * load_avg)/(2 * load_avg + 1) * recent_cpu + nice\n\nwhere load_avg is a moving average of the number of threads ready to run (see\nbelow). If load_avg is 1, indicating that a single thread, on average, is\ncompeting for the CPU, then the current value of recent cpu decays to a weight\nof .1 in log_(2/3) .1 ≈ 6 seconds; if load avg is 2, then decay to a weight\nof .1 takes log_(3/4) .1 ≈ 8 seconds. The effect is that recent cpu\nestimates the amount of CPU time the thread has received \"recently,\" with the\nrate of decay inversely proportional to the number of threads competing for the\nCPU.\nAssumptions made by some of the tests require that these recalculations of\nrecent cpu be made exactly when the system tick counter reaches a multiple of\na second, that is, when timer_ticks () % TIMER_FREQ == 0, and not at any other\ntime.\nThe value of recent_cpu can be negative for a thread with a negative nice value.\nDo not clamp negative recent_cpu to 0.\nYou may need to think about the order of calculations in this formula. We\nrecommend computing the coefficient of recent cpu first, then multiplying. Some\nstudents have reported that multiplying load_avg by recent_cpu directly can\ncause overflow.\nYou must implement thread_get_recent_cpu(), for which there is a skeleton in\nthreads/thread.c.\nint thread_get_recent_cpu (void);\n\n\nReturns 100 times the current thread's recent cpu value, rounded to the\nnearest integer\n\nCalculating load_avg\nFinally, load avg, often known as the system load average, estimates the average\nnumber of threads ready to run over the past minute. Like recent_cpu, it is an\nexponentially weighted moving average. Unlike priority and recent_cpu,\nload_avg is system-wide, not thread-specific. At system boot, it is\ninitialized to 0. Once per second thereafter, it is updated according to the\nfollowing formula:\n\nload_avg = (59/60) * load_avg + (1/60) * ready_threads,\n\nwhere ready threads is the number of threads that are either running or ready to\nrun at time of update (not including the idle thread).\nBecause of assumptions made by some of the tests, load_avg must be updated\nexactly when the system tick counter reaches a multiple of a second, that is,\nwhen timer_ticks () % TIMER_FREQ == 0, and not at any other time.\nYou must implement thread_get_load_avg(), for which there is a skeleton in\nthreads/thread.c.\nint thread_get_load_avg (void)\n\n\nReturns 100 times the current system load average, rounded to the nearest\ninteger.\n\nSummary\nThe following formulas summarize the calculations required to implement the\nscheduler. They are not a complete description of scheduler requirements.\nEvery thread has a nice value between -20 and 20 directly under its control.\nEach thread also has a priority, between 0 (PRI_MIN) through 63 (PRI_MAX),\nwhich is recalculated using the following formula every fourth tick:\n\npriority = PRI_MAX - (recent_cpu / 4) - (nice * 2)\n\nrecent_cpu measures the amount of CPU time a thread has received \"recently.\"\nOn each timer tick, the running thread's recent cpu is incremented by 1. Once\nper second, every thread's recent cpu is updated this way:\n\nrecent_cpu = (2 * load_avg) / (2 * load_avg + 1) * recent_cpu + nice\n\nload_avg estimates the average number of threads ready to run over the past\nminute. It is initialized to 0 at boot and recalculated once per second as\nfollows:\n\nload_avg = (59/60) * load_avg + (1/60) * ready_threads\n\nwhere ready_threads is the number of threads that are either running or ready\nto run at time of update (not including the idle thread).\nFixed-Point Real Arithmetic\nIn the formulas above, priority, nice, and ready_threads are integers, but\nrecent_cpu and load_avg are real numbers. Unfortunately, Pintos does not\nsupport floating-point arithmetic in the kernel, because it would complicate and\nslow the kernel. Real kernels often have the same limitation, for the same\nreason. This means that calculations on real quantities must be simulated using\nintegers. This is not difficult, but many students do not know how to do it.\nThis section explains the basics.\nThe fundamental idea is to treat the rightmost bits of an integer as\nrepresenting a fraction. For example, we can designate the lowest 14 bits of a\nsigned 32-bit integer as fractional bits, so that an integer x represents the\nreal number x/(2^14). This is called a 17.14 fixed-point number\nrepresentation, because there are 17 bits before the decimal point, 14 bits\nafter it, and one sign bit. A number in 17.14 format represents, at maximum, a\nvalue of (2^31 − 1)/(2^14) ≈ 131,071.999.\nSuppose that we are using a p.q fixed-point format, and let f = 2^q. By the\ndefinition above, we can convert an integer or real number into p.q format by\nmultiplying with f. For example, in 17.14 format the fraction 59/60 used in\nthe calculation of load_avg, above, is (59/60)2^14 = 16,110. To convert a\nfixed-point value back to an integer, divide by f. (The normal / operator in\nC rounds toward zero, that is, it rounds positive numbers down and negative\nnumbers up. To round to nearest, add f / 2 to a positive number, or subtract\nit from a negative number, before dividing.)\nMany operations on fixed-point numbers are straightforward. Let x and y be\nfixed-point numbers, and let n be an integer. Then the sum of x and y is\nx + y and their difference is x - y. The sum of x and n is x + n * f;\ndifference, x - n * f; product, x * n; quotient, x / n.\nMultiplying two fixed-point values has two complications. First, the decimal\npoint of the result is q bits too far to the left. Consider that\n(59/60)(59/60) should be slightly less than 1, but\n16,111 × 16,111 = 259,564,321 is much greater than 2^14 = 16,384.\nShifting q bits right, we get 259,564,321/2^14 = 15,842, or about 0.97,\nthe correct answer. Second, the multiplication can overflow even though the\nanswer is representable. For example, 64 in 17.14 format is\n64 × 2^14 = 1,048,576 and its square 64^2 = 4,096 is well within the 17.14\nrange, but 1,048,576^2 = 2^40, greater than the maximum signed 32-bit integer\nvalue 2^31 − 1. An easy solution is to do the multiplication as a 64-bit\noperation. The product of x and y is then ((int64_t) x) * y / f.\nDividing two fixed-point values has opposite issues. The decimal point will be\ntoo far to the right, which we fix by shifting the dividend q bits to the left\nbefore the division. The left shift discards the top q bits of the dividend,\nwhich we can again fix by doing the division in 64 bits. Thus, the quotient when\nx is divided by y is ((int64_t) x) * f / y.\nThis section has consistently used multiplication or division by f, instead of\nq-bit shifts, for two reasons. First, multiplication and division do not have\nthe surprising operator precedence of the C shift operators. Second,\nmultiplication and division are well-defined on negative operands, but the C\nshift operators are not. Take care with these issues in your implementation.\nThe following table summarizes how fixed-point arithmetic operations can be\nimplemented in C. In the table, x and y are fixed-point numbers, n is an\ninteger, fixed-point numbers are in signed p.q format where p + q = 31, and\nf is 1 :\n\n\n\nArithmetic\nC\n\n\n\n\nConvert n to fixed point\nn * f\n\n\nConvert x to integer (rounding toward zero)\nx / f\n\n\nConvert x to integer (rounding to nearest)\n(x + f / 2) / f if x >= 0\n\n\n\n(x - f / 2) / f if x \n\n\nAdd x and y\nx + y\n\n\nSubtract y from x\nx - y\n\n\nAdd x and n\nx + n * f\n\n\nSubtract n from x\nx - n * f\n\n\nMultiply x by y\n((int64_t) x) * y / f\n\n\nMultiply x by n\nx * n\n\n\nDivide x by y\n((int64_t) x) * f / y\n\n\nDivide x by n\nx / n\n\n\n\n"},"project1/FAQ.html":{"url":"project1/FAQ.html","title":"FAQ","keywords":"","body":"FAQ\nHow much code will I need to write?\nHere's a summary of our reference solution, produced by the git diff --stat.\nThe final row gives total lines inserted and deleted; a changed line counts as\nboth an insertion and a deletion.\nThe reference solution represents just one possible solution.

Then run make. If your new file doesn't get compiled,\nrun make clean and then try again. A new .h file does not require editing\nthe Makefiles.\nWhat does warning: no previous prototype for func mean?\nIt means that you defined a non-static function without preceding it by a\nprototype. Because non-static functions are intended for use by other .c\nfiles, for safety they should be prototyped in a header file included before\ntheir definition. To fix the problem, add a prototype in a header file that you\ninclude, or, if the function isn't actually used by other .c files,\nmake it static.\nWhat is the interval between timer interrupts?\nTimer interrupts occur TIMER_FREQ times per second. You can adjust this value\nby editing devices/timer.h. The default is 100 Hz. We don't recommend changing\nthis value, because any changes are likely to cause many of the tests to fail.\nHow long is a time slice?\nThere are TIME_SLICE ticks per time slice. This macro is declared in\nthreads/thread.c. The default is 4 ticks. We don't recommend changing this\nvalue, because any changes are likely to cause many of the tests to fail.\nHow do I run the tests?\nSee Testing.\nWhy do I get a test failure in pass()?\nYou are probably looking at a backtrace that looks something like this:\n0x8004208810: debug_panic (lib/kernel/debug.c:32)\n0x800420a99f: pass (tests/threads/tests.c:93)\n0x800420bdd3: test_mlfqs_load_1 (...threads/mlfqs-load-1.c:33)\n0x800420a8cf: run_test (tests/threads/tests.c:51)\n0x8004200452: run_task (threads/init.c:283)\n0x8004200536: run_actions (threads/init.c:333)\n0x80042000bb: main (threads/init.c:137)\nThis is just confusing output from the backtrace program. It does not actually\nmean that pass() called debug_panic(). In fact, fail() called\ndebug_panic() (via the PANIC() macro). GCC knows that debug_panic() does\nnot return, because it is declared NO_RETURN,\nso it doesn't include any code in fail() to take control when debug_panic()\nreturns. This means that the return address on the stack looks like it is at the\nbeginning of the function that happens to follow fail() in memory, which in\nthis case happens to be pass(). See Backtraces for more information.\nHow do interrupts get re-enabled in the new thread following schedule()?\nEvery path into schedule() disables interrupts. They eventually get re-enabled\nby the next thread to be scheduled. Consider the possibilities: the new thread\nis running in switch_thread() (but see below), which is called by schedule(),\nwhich is called by one of a few possible functions:\n\nthread_exit()\nbut we'll never switch back into such a thread, so it's uninteresting.\nthread_yield()\nwhich immediately restores the interrupt level upon return from schedule().\nthread_block()\nwhich is called from multiple places:\nsema_down()\nwhich immediately restores the interrupt level upon return from schedule().\nidle()\nwhich enables interrupts with an explicit assembly STI instruction.\nwait() in devices/intq.c,\nwhose callers are responsible for reenabling interrupts\n\n\n\nThere is a special case when a newly created thread runs for the first time.\nSuch a thread calls intr_enable() as the first action in kernel_thread(),\nwhich is at the bottom of the call stack for every kernel thread but the first.\nDo I need to account for timer values overflowing?\nDon't worry about the possibility of timer values overflowing. Timer values are\nexpressed as signed 64-bit numbers, which at 100 ticks per second should be\ngood for almost 2,924,712,087 years.\nDoesn't priority scheduling lead to starvation?\nYes, strict priority scheduling can lead to starvation because a thread will not\nrun if any higher-priority thread is runnable. The advanced scheduler introduces\na mechanism for dynamically changing thread priorities. Strict priority\nscheduling is valuable in real-time systems because it offers the programmer\nmore control over which jobs get processing time. High priorities\nare generally reserved for time-critical tasks. It's not \"fair,\" but it\naddresses other concerns not applicable to a general-purpose operating system.\nWhat thread should run after a lock has been released?\nWhen a lock is released, the highest priority thread waiting for that lock\nshould be unblocked and put on the list of ready threads. The scheduler should\nthen run the highest priority thread on the ready list.\nIf the highest-priority thread yields, does it continue running?\nYes. If there is a single highest-priority thread, it continues running until it\nblocks or finishes, even if it calls thread_yield(). If multiple threads have\nthe same highest priority, thread_yield() should switch among them in\n\"round robin\" order.\nWhat happens to the priority of a donating thread?\nPriority donation only changes the priority of the donee thread. The donor\nthread's priority is unchanged. Priority donation is not additive: if thread A\n(with priority 5) donates to thread B (with priority 3), then B's new priority\nis 5, not 8.\nCan a thread's priority change while it is on the ready queue?\nYes. Consider a ready, low-priority thread L that holds a lock. High-priority\nthread H attempts to acquire the lock and blocks, thereby donating its priority\nto ready thread L.\nCan a thread's priority change while it is blocked?\nYes. While a thread that has acquired lock L is blocked for any reason, its\npriority can increase by priority donation if a higher-priority thread attempts\nto acquire L. This case is checked by the priority-donate-sema test.\nCan a thread added to the ready list preempt the processor?\nYes. If a thread added to the ready list has higher priority than the running\nthread, the correct behavior is to immediately yield the processor. It is not\nacceptable to wait for the next timer interrupt. The highest priority thread\nshould run as soon as it is runnable, preempting whatever thread is currently\nrunning.\nHow does thread_set_priority() affect a thread receiving donations?\nIt sets the thread's base priority. The thread's effective priority becomes the\nhigher of the newly set priority or the highest donated priority. When the\ndonations are released, the thread's priority becomes the one set through the\nfunction call. This behavior is checked by the priority-donate-lower test.\nDoubled test names in output make them fail.\nSuppose you are seeing output in which some test names are doubled, like this:\n(alarm-priority) begin\n(alarm-priority) (alarm-priority) Thread priority 30 woke up.\nThread priority 29 woke up.\n(alarm-priority) Thread priority 28 woke up.\nWhat is happening is that output from two threads is being interleaved. That is,\none thread is printing (alarm-priority) Thread priority 29 woke up.\\n\nand another thread is printing (alarm-priority) Thread priority 30 woke up.\\n,\nbut the first thread is being preempted by the second in the middle of its\noutput. This problem indicates a bug in your priority scheduler. After all, a\nthread with priority 29 should not be able to run while a thread with priority\n30 has work to do. Normally, the implementation of the printf() function in\nthe Pintos kernel attempts to prevent such interleaved output by acquiring a\nconsole lock during the duration of the printf call and releasing it afterwards.\nHowever, the output of the test name, e.g., (alarm-priority), and the message\nfollowing it is output using two calls to printf, resulting in the console lock\nbeing acquired and released twice.\nHow does priority donation interact with the advanced scheduler?\nIt doesn't have to. We won't test priority donation and the advanced scheduler\nat the same time.\nCan I use one queue instead of 64 queues?\nYes. In general, your implementation may differ from the description, as long\nas its behavior is the same.\nSome scheduler tests fail and I don't understand why. Help!\nIf your implementation mysteriously fails some of the advanced scheduler tests,\ntry the following:\n\nRead the source files for the tests that you're failing, to make sure that\nyou understand what's going on. Each one has a comment at the top that\nexplains its purpose and expected results.\nDouble-check your fixed-point arithmetic routines and your use of them in\nthe scheduler routines.\nConsider how much work your implementation does in the timer interrupt.\nIf the timer interrupt handler takes too long, then it will take away most of\na timer tick from the thread that the timer interrupt preempted. When it\nreturns control to that thread, it therefore won't get to do much work before\nthe next timer interrupt arrives. That thread will therefore get blamed for\na lot more CPU time than it actually got a chance to use. This raises the\ninterrupted thread's recent CPU count, thereby lowering its priority. It\ncan cause scheduling decisions to change. It also raises the load average.\n\n"},"project2/introduction.html":{"url":"project2/introduction.html","title":"Introduction","keywords":"","body":"Project2: User Programs\nNow that you've worked with Pintos and are becoming familiar with its\ninfrastructure and thread package, it's time to start working on the parts of\nthe system that allow running user programs. The base code already supports\nloading and running user programs, but no I/O or interactivity is possible. In\nthis project, you will enable programs to interact with the OS via system calls.\nYou will be working out of the userprog directory for this assignment, but you\nwill also be interacting with almost every other part of Pintos. We will\ndescribe the relevant parts below.\nYou must build project 2 on top of your project 1 submission. Although no\ncode from project 1 affects code for project 2, you still have to pass test\ncases for project 1 because this is an incremental project.\nAlso, please notify there is extra challenge from project2. This is just an\noptional implementation. Also, for the extra challenge, there isn't any\nskeleton code for you except the test cases. All designs are up to you.\nTo submit and test your extra requirements, you will need to edit\nuserprog/Make.vars.\nLastly, please note that the code without TODO does not always you don't need\nto change that code. You can freely modify any source codes in project2, except\nthe testing codes.\nBackground\nUp to now, all of the code you have run under Pintos has been part of the\noperating system kernel. This means, for example, that all the test code from\nthe last assignment ran as part of the kernel, with full access to privileged\nparts of the system. Once we start running user programs on top of the operating\nsystem, this is no longer true. This project deals with the consequences.\nWe allow more than one process to run at a time. Each process has one thread\n(multithreaded processes are not supported). User programs are written under the\nillusion that they have the entire machine. This means that when you load and\nrun multiple processes at a time, you must manage memory, scheduling, and other\nstate correctly to maintain this illusion.\nIn the previous project, we compiled our test code directly into your kernel,\nso we had to require certain specific function interfaces within the kernel.\nFrom now on, we will test your operating system by running user programs. This\ngives you much greater freedom. You must make sure that the user program\ninterface meets the specifications described here, but given that constraint you\nare free to restructure or rewrite kernel code however you wish. All of your\ncodes should never located in block that enclosed by #ifdef VM. This blocks\nwill be included after enabling the virtual memory subsystem, which you will\nimplement in the project 3. Also, if the codes is enclosed by #ifndef VM,\nthose codes will be omitted from project3.\nWe strongly recommend you to read\nsynchronization and virtual\naddrees before you start.\nSource Files\nThe easiest way to get an overview of the programming you will be doing is to\nsimply go over each part you'll be working with. In userprog, you'll find a\nsmall number of files, but here is where the bulk of your work will be:\n\nprocess.c, process.h\nLoads ELF binaries and starts processes.\n\nsyscall.c, syscall.h\nWhenever a user process wants to access some kernel functionality, it invokes\na system call. This is a skeleton system call handler. Currently, it just\nprints a message and terminates the user process. In part 2 of this project\nyou will add code to do everything else needed by system calls.\n\nsyscall-entry.S\nSmall assembly codes that bootstrap the system call handler. You\ndon't need to understand this code.\n\nexception.c, exception.h\nWhen a user process performs a privileged or prohibited operation, it traps\ninto the kernel as an exception or fault. These files handle exceptions.\nCurrently all exceptions simply print a message and terminate the process.\nSome, but not all, solutions to project 2 require modifying page_fault() in\nthis file.\n\n\n\ngdt.c, gdt.h\nThe x86-64 is a segmented architecture. The Global Descriptor Table (GDT)\nis a table that describes the segments in use. These files set up the GDT.\nYou should not need to modify these files for any of the projects. You can\nread the code if you're interested in how the GDT works.\n\ntss.c, tss.h\nThe Task-State Segment (TSS) was used for x86 architectural task switching.\nHowever, in x86-64, task switching is deprecated. Nontheless, TSS is still\nthere to find the stack pointer during the ring switching.\nThis means when a user process enters an interrupt handler, the hardware\nconsults to the tss to look up the kernel's stack pointer. You should not need\nto modify these files for any of the pojects. You can read the code if you're\ninterested in how the TSS works.\n\n\nUsing the File System\nYou will need to interface to the file system code for this project, because\nuser programs are loaded from the file system and many of the system calls you\nmust implement deal with the file system. However, the focus of this project is\nnot the file system, so we have provided a simple but complete file system in\nthe filesys directory. You will want to look over the filesys.h and file.h\ninterfaces to understand how to use the file system, and especially its many\nlimitations.\nThere is no need to modify the file system code for this project, and so we\nrecommend that you do not. Working on the file system is likely to distract you\nfrom this project's focus.\nProper use of the file system routines now will make life much easier for\nproject 4, when you improve the file system implementation. Until then, you\nwill have to tolerate the following limitations:\n\nNo internal synchronization. Concurrent accesses will interfere with one\nanother. You should use synchronization to ensure that only one process at a\ntime is executing file system code.\nFile size is fixed at creation time. The root directory is represented as a\nfile, so the number of files that may be created is also limited.\nFile data is allocated as a single extent, that is, data in a single file must\noccupy a contiguous range of sectors on disk. External fragmentation can\ntherefore become a serious problem as a file system is used over time.\nNo subdirectories\nFile names are limited to 14 characters.\nA system crash mid-operation may corrupt the disk in a way that cannot be\nrepaired automatically. There is no file system repair tool anyway.\n\nOne important feature is included:\nUnix-like semantics for filesys_remove() are implemented. That is, if a file\nis open when it is removed, its blocks are not deallocated and it may still be\naccessed by any threads that have it open, until the last one closes it. See\nRemoving an Open File for more information.\n\nUnlike project 1 where all test programs were already present in the kernel image,\nyou have to put test programs (which runs in the user space) into the Pintos\nvirtual machine. To make your life much easier, our testing scripts\n(i.e. make check) automatically handle this, so in most cases, you don't need\nto understand this. However, knowing this would significantly help you to run\nindividual test cases.\nTo put a file into the Pintos virtual machine, firstly you need to be able to\ncreate a simulated disk with a file system partition. The\npintos-mkdisk program provides this functionality. From the userprog/build\ndirectory, execute pintos-mkdisk filesys.dsk 2. This command\ncreates a simulated disk named filesys.dsk that contains a 2 MB Pintos file\nsystem partition. Then, specify the disk by passing --fs-disk filesys.dsk\nafter pintos but before -- (i.e. pintos --fs-disk filesys.disk -- KERNEL_COMMANDS...).\nThe -- is needed because --fs-disk is for the pintos script, not for\nthe simulated kernel. Afterward, format the file system partition by passing\n-f -q on the kernel's command line: pintos SCRIPT_COMMANDS -- -f -q. The -f\noption causes the file system to be formatted, and -q causes Pintos to exit\nas soon as the format is done.\nYou'll need a way to copy files in and out of the simulated file system. The\npintos -p (\"put\") and -g (\"get\") options do this. To copy 'file' into the\nPintos file system, use the command pintos -p file -- -q. To copy it\nto the Pintos file system under the name newname, add :newname after the\noriginal filename: pintos -p file:newname -- -q. The commands for copying\nfiles out of a VM are similar, but substitute -g for -p.\nIncidentally, these commands work by passing special commands extract and append\non the kernel's command line and copying to and from a special simulated\n\"scratch\" partition. If you're very curious, you can look at the pintos script\nas well as filesys/fsutil.c to learn the implementation details.\nHere's a summary of how to create a disk with a file system partition, format\nthe file system, copy the args-single program—which is the second test case for\nthis project—into the new disk, and then run it, passing argument 'onearg'.\n(Argument passing won't work until you implemented it.) It assumes that you've\nalready built the test cases and that the current directory is userprog/build:\npintos-mkdisk filesys.dsk 10\npintos --fs-disk filesys.dsk -p tests/userprog/args-single:args-single -- -q -f run 'args-single onearg'\n\nIf you don't want to keep the file system disk around for later use or\ninspection, you can even combine all four steps into a single command.\nThe --filesys-size=n option creates a temporary file system partition\napproximately n megabytes in size just for the duration of the pintos run.\nThe Pintos automatic test suite makes extensive use of this syntax:\npintos --fs-disk=10 -p tests/userprog/args-single:args-single -- -q -f run 'args-single onearg'\n\nHow User Programs Work\nPintos can run normal C programs, as long as they fit into memory and use only\nthe system calls you implement. Notably, malloc() cannot be implemented\nbecause none of the system calls required for this project allow for memory\nallocation. Pintos also can't run programs that use floating point operations,\nsince the kernel doesn't save and restore the processor's floating-point unit\nwhen switching threads.\nPintos can load ELF executables with the loader provided for you in\nuserprog/process.c. ELF is a file format used by Linux, Solaris, and many\nother operating systems for object files, shared libraries, and executables.\nYou can actually use any compiler and linker that output x86-64 ELF executables\nto produce programs for Pintos. (We've provided compilers and linkers that\nshould do just fine.) You should realize immediately that, until you copy a test\nprogram to the simulated file system, Pintos will be unable to do useful work.\nYou won't be able to do interesting things until you copy a variety of programs\nto the file system. You might want to create a clean reference file system disk\nand copy that over whenever you trash your filesys.dsk beyond a useful state,\nwhich may happen occasionally while debugging.\nVirtual Memory Layout\nVirtual memory in Pintos is divided into two regions: user virtual memory and\nkernel virtual memory. User virtual memory ranges from virtual address 0 up to\nKERN_BASE, which is defined in include/threads/vaddr.h and defaults to\n0x8004000000 Kernel virtual memory occupies the rest of the virtual address\nspace.\nUser virtual memory is per-process. When the kernel switches from one process to\nanother, it also switches user virtual address spaces by changing the\nprocessor's page directory base register (see pml4_activate() in\nthread/mmu.c). struct thread contains a pointer to a process's page table.\nKernel virtual memory is global. It is always mapped the same way, regardless\nof what user process or kernel thread is running. In Pintos, kernel virtual\nmemory is mapped one-to-one to physical memory, starting at KERN_BASE. That\nis, virtual address KERN_BASE accesses physical address 0, virtual address\nKERN_BASE + 0x1234 accesses physical address 0x1234, and so on up to the\nsize of the machine's physical memory.\nA user program can only access its own user virtual memory. An attempt to access\nkernel virtual memory causes a page fault, handled by page_fault() in\nuserprog/exception.c, and the process will be terminated. Kernel threads can\naccess both kernel virtual memory and, if a user process is running, the user\nvirtual memory of the running process. However, even in the kernel, an attempt\nto access memory at an unmapped user virtual address will cause a page fault.\nTypical Memory Layout\nConceptually, each process is free to lay out its own user virtual memory\nhowever it chooses. In practice, user virtual memory is laid out like this:\nUSER_STACK +----------------------------------+\n           |             user stack           |\n           |                 |                |\n           |                 |                |\n           |                 V                |\n           |           grows downward         |\n           |                                  |\n           |                                  |\n           |                                  |\n           |                                  |\n           |           grows upward           |\n           |                 ^                |\n           |                 |                |\n           |                 |                |\n           +----------------------------------+\n           | uninitialized data segment (BSS) |\n           +----------------------------------+\n           |     initialized data segment     |\n           +----------------------------------+\n           |            code segment          |\n 0x400000  +----------------------------------+\n           |                                  |\n           |                                  |\n           |                                  |\n           |                                  |\n           |                                  |\n       0   +----------------------------------+\nIn this project, the user stack is fixed in size, but in project 3 it will be\nallowed to grow. Traditionally, the size of the uninitialized data segment can\nbe adjusted with a system call, but you will not have to implement this.\nThe code segment in Pintos starts at user virtual address 0x400000,\napproximately 128 MB from the bottom of the address space. This value was\ntypical value in ubuntu and has no deep significance.\nThe linker sets the layout of a user program in memory, as directed by a \"linker\nscript\" that tells it the names and locations of the various program segments.\nYou can learn more about linker scripts by reading the \"Scripts\" chapter in the\nlinker manual, accessible via info ld.\nTo view the layout of a particular executable, run objdump with the -p option.\nAccessing User Memory\nAs part of a system call, the kernel must often access memory through pointers\nprovided by a user program. The kernel must be very careful about doing so,\nbecause the user can pass a null pointer, a pointer to unmapped virtual memory,\nor a pointer to kernel virtual address space (above KERN_BASE). All of these\ntypes of invalid pointers must be rejected without harm to the kernel or other\nrunning processes, by terminating the offending process and freeing its\nresources.\nThere are at least two reasonable ways to do this correctly. The first method is\nto verify the validity of a user-provided pointer, then dereference it. If you\nchoose this route, you'll want to look at the functions in thread/mmu.c\nand in include/threads/vaddr.h. This is the simplest way to handle user\nmemory access.\nThe second method is to check only that a user pointer points below KERN_BASE,\nthen dereference it. An invalid user pointer will cause a \"page fault\" that you\ncan handle by modifying the code for page_fault() in userprog/exception.c.\nThis technique is normally faster because it takes advantage of the processor's\nMMU, so it tends to be used in real kernels (including Linux).\nIn either case, you need to make sure not to \"leak\" resources. For example,\nsuppose that your system call has acquired a lock or allocated memory with\nmalloc(). If you encounter an invalid user pointer afterward, you must still\nbe sure to release the lock or free the page of memory. If you choose to verify\nuser pointers before dereferencing them, this should be straightforward. It's\nmore difficult to handle if an invalid pointer causes a page fault, because\nthere's no way to return an error code from a memory access. Therefore, for\nthose who want to try the latter technique, we'll provide a little bit of\nhelpful code:\n/* Reads a byte at user virtual address UADDR.\n * UADDR must be below KERN_BASE.\n * Returns the byte value if successful, -1 if a segfault\n * occurred. */\nstatic int64_t\nget_user (const uint8_t *uaddr) {\n    int64_t result;\n    __asm __volatile (\n    \"movabsq $done_get, %0\\n\"\n    \"movzbq %1, %0\\n\"\n    \"done_get:\\n\"\n    : \"=&a\" (result) : \"m\" (*uaddr));\n    return result;\n}\n\n/* Writes BYTE to user address UDST.\n * UDST must be below KERN_BASE.\n * Returns true if successful, false if a segfault occurred. */\nstatic bool\nput_user (uint8_t *udst, uint8_t byte) {\n    int64_t error_code;\n    __asm __volatile (\n    \"movabsq $done_put, %0\\n\"\n    \"movb %b2, %1\\n\"\n    \"done_put:\\n\"\n    : \"=&a\" (error_code), \"=m\" (*udst) : \"q\" (byte));\n    return error_code != -1;\n}\n\nEach of these functions assumes that the user address has already been verified\nto be below KERN_BASE. They also assume that you've modified page_fault() so\nthat a page fault in the kernel merely sets rax to -1 and copies its former\nvalue into %rip.\n"},"project2/argument_passing.html":{"url":"project2/argument_passing.html","title":"Argument Passing","keywords":"","body":"Argument Passing\nSetup the argument for user program in process_exec()\nx86-64 Calling Convention\nThis section summarizes important points of the convention used for normal\nfunction calls on 64-bit x86-64 implementations of Unix. Some details are\nomitted for brevity. For more detail, you can refer\nSystem V AMD64 ABI.\nThe calling convention works like this:\n\nUser-level applications use as integer registers for passing the sequence\n%rdi, %rsi, %rdx, %rcx, %r8 and %r9.\nThe caller pushes the address of its next instruction (the return address) on\nthe stack and jumps to the first instruction of the callee. A single x86-64\ninstruction, CALL, does both.\nThe callee executes.\nIf the callee has a return value, it stores it into register RAX.\nThe callee returns by popping the return address from the stack and jumping\nto the location it specifies, using the x86-64 RET instruction.\n\nConsider a function f() that takes three int arguments. This diagram shows a\nsample stack frame and register state as seen by the callee at the beginning of\nstep 3 above, supposing that f() is invoked as f(1, 2, 3).\nThe initial stack address is arbitrary:\n                             +----------------+\nstack pointer --> 0x4747fe70 | return address |\n                             +----------------+\nRDI: 0x0000000000000001 | RSI: 0x0000000000000002 | RDX: 0x0000000000000003\nProgram Startup Details\nThe Pintos C library for user programs designates _start(), in\nlib/user/entry.c, as the entry point for user programs. This function is a\nwrapper around main() that calls exit() if main() returns:\nvoid\n_start (int argc, char *argv[]) {\n    exit (main (argc, argv));\n}\n\nThe kernel must put the arguments for the initial function on the register\nbefore it allows the user program to begin executing. The arguments are passed\nin the same way as the normal calling convention.\nConsider how to handle arguments for the following example command:\n/bin/ls -l foo bar.\n\nBreak the command into words: /bin/ls, -l, foo, bar.\n\nPlace the words at the top of the stack. Order doesn't matter,\nbecause they will be referenced through pointers.\n\nPush the address of each string plus a null pointer sentinel, on the\nstack, in right-to-left order. These are the elements of argv. The null pointer\nsentinel ensures that argv[argc] is a null pointer, as required by the C\nstandard. The order ensures that argv[0] is at the lowest virtual address.\nWord-aligned accesses are faster than unaligned accesses, so for best\nperformance round the stack pointer down to a multiple of 8 before the first\npush.\n\nPoint %rsi to argv (the address of argv[0]) and set %rdi to argc.\n\nFinally, push a fake \"return address\": although the entry function will never\nreturn, its stack frame must have the same structure as any other.\n\n\nThe table below shows the state of the stack and the relevant registers right\nbefore the beginning of the user program.\nNote that the stack grows down.\n\n\n\nAddress\nName\nData\nType\n\n\n\n\n0x4747fffc\nargv[3][...]\n'bar\\0'\nchar[4]\n\n\n0x4747fff8\nargv[2][...]\n'foo\\0'\nchar[4]\n\n\n0x4747fff5\nargv[1][...]\n'-l\\0'\nchar[3]\n\n\n0x4747ffed\nargv[0][...]\n'/bin/ls\\0'\nchar[8]\n\n\n0x4747ffe8\nword-align\n0\nuint8_t[]\n\n\n0x4747ffe0\nargv[4]\n0\nchar *\n\n\n0x4747ffd8\nargv[3]\n0x4747fffc\nchar *\n\n\n0x4747ffd0\nargv[2]\n0x4747fff8\nchar *\n\n\n0x4747ffc8\nargv[1]\n0x4747fff5\nchar *\n\n\n0x4747ffc0\nargv[0]\n0x4747ffed\nchar *\n\n\n0x4747ffb8\nreturn address\n0\nvoid (*) ()\n\n\n\n\nRDI: 4 | RSI: 0x4747ffc0\n\nIn this example, the stack pointer would be initialized to 0x4747ffb8\nAs shown above, your code should start the stack at the USER_STACK, which is\ndefined in include/threads/vaddr.h.\nYou may find the non-standard hex_dump() function, declared in ,\nuseful for debugging your argument passing code.\nImplement the argument passing.\nCurrently, process_exec() does not support passing arguments to new\nprocesses. Implement this functionality, by extending process_exec() so\nthat instead of simply taking a program file name as its argument, it divides it\ninto words at spaces. The first word is the program name, the second word is the\nfirst argument, and so on. That is, process_exec(\"grep foo bar\") should run\ngrep passing two arguments foo and bar.\nWithin a command line, multiple spaces are equivalent to a single space, so that\nprocess_exec(\"grep foo bar\") is equivalent to our original example. You can\nimpose a reasonable limit on the length of the command line arguments. For\nexample, you could limit the arguments to those that will fit in a single page\n(4 kB). (There is an unrelated limit of 128 bytes on command-line arguments that\nthe pintos utility can pass to the kernel.)\nYou can parse argument strings any way you like. If you're lost, look at\nstrtok_r(), prototyped in include/lib/string.h and implemented with thorough\ncomments in lib/string.c. You can find more about it by looking at the man\npage (run man strtok_r at the prompt).\n"},"project2/user_memory.html":{"url":"project2/user_memory.html","title":"User Memory","keywords":"","body":"User Memory Access\nImplement user memory access\nTo implement syscalls, you need to provide ways to read and write\ndata in user virtual address space.

The skeleton\nimplementation we provide \"handles\" system calls by terminating the process. It\nwill need to retrieve the system call number, then any system call arguments,\nand carry out appropriate actions.\nSystem Call Details\nThe first project already dealt with one way that the operating system can\nregain control from a user program: interrupts from timers and I/O devices.\nThese are \"external\" interrupts, because they are caused by entities outside\nthe CPU.\nThe operating system also deals with software exceptions, which are events that\noccur in program code. These can be errors such as a page fault or division by\nzero. Exceptions are also the means by which a user program can request services\n(\"system calls\") from the operating system.\nIn traditional x86 architecture, the system call was handled as same as other\nsoftware exceptions. However, in x86-64, manufacturers introduce special\ninstruction for the system calls, syscall. This provides fast way to call the\nsystem call handler.\nNowaday, the syscall instruction is the most commonly used means for invoking\nsystem calls in x86-64. In Pintos, user programs invoke syscall to make a\nsystem call. The system call number and any additional arguments are expected to\nbe set to the registers in the normal fashion before invoking the syscall\ninstruction except two points:\n\n%rax is the system call number.\nThe fourth argument is %r10, not %rcx.\n\nThus, when the system call handler syscall_handler() gets control, the system\ncall number is in the rax, and arguments are passed with the order %rdi, %rsi,\n%rdx, %r10, %r8, and %r9.\nThe caller's registers are accessible to struct intr_frame passed to it.\n(struct intr_frame is on the kernel stack.)\nThe x86-64 convention for function return values is to place them in the RAX\nregister. System calls that return a value can do so by modifying the rax\nmember of struct intr_frame.\nImplement the following system calls.\nThe prototypes listed are those seen by a user program that includes\ninclude/lib/user/syscall.h (This header, and all others in include/lib/user,\nare for use by user programs only). System call numbers for each system call are\ndefined in include/lib/syscall-nr.h:\n\nvoid halt (void);\n\n\nTerminates Pintos by calling power_off() (declared in\nsrc/include/threads/init.h). This should be seldom used, because you lose\nsome information about possible deadlock situations, etc.\n\n\nvoid exit (int status);\n\n\nTerminates the current user program, returning status to the kernel. If the\nprocess's parent waits for it (see below), this is the status that will be\nreturned. Conventionally, a status of 0 indicates success and nonzero\nvalues indicate errors.\n\n\npid_t fork (const char *thread_name);\n\n\nCreate new process which is the clone of current process with the name\nTHREAD_NAME. You don't need to clone the value of the registers except %RBX,\n%RSP, %RBP, and %R12 - %R15, which are callee-saved registers.\nMust return pid of the child process, otherwise shouldn't be a valid pid. In\nchild process, the return value should be 0. The child\nshould have DUPLICATED resources including file descriptor and virtual\nmemory space. Parent process should never return from the fork until it knows\nwhether the child process successfully cloned. That is, if the child process\nfail to duplicate the resource, the fork () call of parent should return the\nTID_ERROR.\nThe template utilizes the pml4_for_each() in threads/mmu.c to\ncopy entire user memory space, including corresponding pagetable structures,\nbut you need to fill missing parts of passed pte_for_each_func\n(See virtual address).\n\n\nint exec (const char *cmd_line);\n\n\nChange current process to the executable whose name is given in cmd_line,\npassing any given arguments. This never returns if successful. Otherwise the\nprocess terminates with exit state -1, if the program cannot load or run\nfor any reason. This function does not change the name of the thread that\ncalled exec. Please note that file descriptors remain open across an exec\ncall.\n\n\nint wait (pid_t pid);\n\n\nWaits for a child process pid and retrieves the child's exit status. If\npid is still alive, waits until it terminates. Then, returns the status that\npid passed to exit. If pid did not call exit(), but was terminated by the\nkernel (e.g. killed due to an exception), wait(pid) must return -1. It is\nperfectly legal for a parent process to wait for child processes that have\nalready terminated by the time the parent calls wait, but the kernel must\nstill allow the parent to retrieve its child’s exit status, or learn that the\nchild was terminated by the kernel.\nwait must fail and return -1 immediately if any of the following\nconditions is true:\n\npid does not refer to a direct child of the calling process. pid is a\ndirect child of the calling process if and only if the calling process\nreceived pid as a return value from a successful call to fork.\nNote that children are not inherited: if A spawns child B and B spawns child\nprocess C, then A cannot wait for C, even if B is dead. A call to wait(C) by\nprocess A must fail. Similarly, orphaned processes are not assigned to a new\nparent if their parent process exits before they do.\nThe process that calls wait has already called wait on pid. That is, a\nprocess may wait for any given child at most once.\n\n\nProcesses may spawn any number of children, wait for them in any order, and\nmay even exit without having waited for some or all of their children. Your\ndesign should consider all the ways in which waits can occur. All of a\nprocess's resources, including its struct thread, must be freed whether its\nparent ever waits for it or not, and regardless of whether the child exits\nbefore or after its parent.\nYou must ensure that Pintos does not terminate until the initial process exits.\nThe supplied Pintos code tries to do this by calling process_wait() (in\nuserprog/process.c) from main() (in threads/init.c). We suggest that you\nimplement process_wait() according to the comment at the top of the function\nand then implement the wait system call in terms of process_wait().\nImplementing this system call requires considerably more work than any of the\nrest.\n\nbool create (const char *file, unsigned initial_size);\n\n\nCreates a new file called file initially initial_size bytes in size.\nReturns true if successful, false otherwise. Creating a new file does not open\nit: opening the new file is a separate operation which would require a open\nsystem call.\n\n\nbool remove (const char *file);\n\n\nDeletes the file called file. Returns true if successful, false otherwise. A\nfile may be removed regardless of whether it is open or closed, and removing\nan open file does not close it. See Removing an Open File in FAQ\nfor details.\n\n\nint open (const char *file);\n\n\nOpens the file called file. Returns a nonnegative integer handle called a\n\"file descriptor\" (fd), or -1 if the file could not be opened.\nFile descriptors numbered 0 and 1 are reserved for the console: fd 0\n(STDIN_FILENO) is standard input, fd 1 (STDOUT_FILENO) is standard output.\nThe open system call will never return either of these file descriptors,\nwhich are valid as system call arguments only as explicitly described below.\nEach process has an independent set of file descriptors. File descriptors are\ninherited by child processes. When a single file is opened more than once,\nwhether by a single process or different processes, each open returns a new\nfile descriptor. Different file descriptors for a single file are closed\nindependently in separate calls to close and they do not share a file\nposition. You should follow the linux scheme, which returns integer starting\nfrom zero, to do the extra.\n\n\nint filesize (int fd);\n\n\nReturns the size, in bytes, of the file open as fd.\n\n\nint read (int fd, void *buffer, unsigned size);\n\n\nReads size bytes from the file open as fd into buffer. Returns the\nnumber of bytes actually read (0 at end of file), or -1 if the file could\nnot be read (due to a condition other than end of file). fd 0 reads from the\nkeyboard using input_getc().\n\n\nint write (int fd, const void *buffer, unsigned size);\n\n\nWrites size bytes from buffer to the open file fd. Returns the number of\nbytes actually written, which may be less than size if some bytes could not\nbe written. Writing past end-of-file would normally extend the file, but file\ngrowth is not implemented by the basic file system. The expected behavior is\nto write as many bytes as possible up to end-of-file and return the actual\nnumber written, or 0 if no bytes could be written at all. fd 1 writes to\nthe console. Your code to write to the console should write all of buffer in\none call to putbuf(), at least as long as size is not bigger than a few\nhundred bytes (It is reasonable to break up larger buffers). Otherwise, lines\nof text output by different processes may end up interleaved on the console,\nconfusing both human readers and our grading scripts.\n\n\nvoid seek (int fd, unsigned position);\n\n\nChanges the next byte to be read or written in open file fd to position,\nexpressed in bytes from the beginning of the file (Thus, a position of 0\nis the file's start). A seek past the current end of a file is not an error. A\nlater read obtains 0 bytes, indicating end of file. A later write extends\nthe file, filling any unwritten gap with zeros. (However, in Pintos files have\na fixed length until project 4 is complete, so writes past end of file will\nreturn an error.) These semantics are implemented in the file system and do\nnot require any special effort in system call implementation.\n\n\nunsigned tell (int fd);\n\n\nReturns the position of the next byte to be read or written in open file fd,\nexpressed in bytes from the beginning of the file.\n\n\nvoid close (int fd);\n\n\nCloses file descriptor fd. Exiting or terminating a process implicitly\ncloses all its open file descriptors, as if by calling this function for each\none.\n\nThe file defines other syscalls. Ignore them for now. You will implement some of\nthem in project 3 and the rest in project 4, so be sure to design your system\nwith extensibility in mind.\nYou must synchronize system calls so that any number of user processes can make\nthem at once. In particular, it is not safe to call into the file system code\nprovided in the filesys directory from multiple threads at once. Your system\ncall implementation must treat the file system code as a critical section.\nDon't forget that process_exec() also accesses files. For now, we recommend\nagainst modifying code in the filesys directory.\nWe have provided you a user-level function for each system call in\nlib/user/syscall.c. These provide a way for user processes to invoke each\nsystem call from a C program. Each uses a little inline assembly code to invoke\nthe system call and (if appropriate) returns the system call's return value.\nWhen you're done with this part, and forevermore, Pintos should be bulletproof.\nNothing that a user program can do should ever cause the OS to crash, panic,\nfail an assertion, or otherwise malfunction. It is important to emphasize this\npoint: our tests will try to break your system calls in many, many ways. You\nneed to think of all the corner cases and handle them. The sole way a user\nprogram should be able to cause the OS to halt is by invoking the halt system\ncall.\nIf a system call is passed an invalid argument, acceptable options include\nreturning an error value (for those calls that return a value), returning an\nundefined value, or terminating the process.\n"},"project2/process_termination.html":{"url":"project2/process_termination.html","title":"Process Termination Messages","keywords":"","body":"Process Termination Message\nPrint out the process termination message\nWhenever a user process terminates, because it called exit or for any other\nreason, print the process's name and exit code, formatted as if printed by\nprintf (\"%s: exit(%d)\\n\", ...);\n\nThe name printed should be the full name passed to fork().

You can choose whatever suitable types you\nlike for tid_t and pid_t. By default, they're both int.

You may impose a limit of 128 open\nfiles per process, if necessary.

A page must be\npage-aligned, that is, start on a virtual address evenly divisible by the\npage size. Thus, the last 12 bits of a 64-bit virtual address is the\npage offset (or just offset). The upper bits are used to indicate\nthe index in the page table, which will be introduced soon. With 64-bit system,\nwe use 4-level page table, which makes a virtual address to look like this:\n63          48 47            39 38            30 29            21 20         12 11         0\n+-------------+----------------+----------------+----------------+-------------+------------+\n| Sign Extend |    Page-Map    | Page-Directory | Page-directory |  Page-Table |    Page    |\n|             | Level-4 Offset |    Pointer     |     Offset     |   Offset    |   Offset   |\n+-------------+----------------+----------------+----------------+-------------+------------+\n              |                |                |                |             |            |\n              +------- 9 ------+------- 9 ------+------- 9 ------+----- 9 -----+---- 12 ----+\n                                          Virtual Address\nEach process has an independent set of user (virtual) pages, which are those\npages below the virtual address KERN_BASE (0x8004000000). The set of\nkernel (virtual) pages, on the other hand, is global, and thus remain in\nthe same position\nregardless of what thread or process is running. The kernel may access both user\nand kernel pages, but a user process may access only its own user pages. See\nVirtual Memory Layout, for more information.\nPintos provides several useful functions for working with virtual addresses.\nSee Section Virtual Addresses, for details.\nFrames\nA frame, sometimes called a physical frame or a page frame, is\na continuous region of physical memory. Like pages, frames must be page-size and\npage-aligned. Thus, a 64-bit physical address can be divided into a\nframe number and a frame offset (or just offset), like this:\n                          12 11         0\n    +-----------------------+-----------+\n    |      Frame Number     |   Offset  |\n    +-----------------------+-----------+\n              Physical Address\nx86-64 doesn't provide any way to directly access memory at a physical\naddress. Pintos works around this by mapping kernel virtual memory directly to\nphysical memory - the first page of kernel virtual memory is mapped to the first\nframe of physical memory, the second page to the second frame, and so on. Thus,\nframes can be accessed through kernel virtual memory.\nPintos provides functions for translating between physical addresses and kernel\nvirtual addresses. See Virtual Addresses for\ndetails.\nPage Tables\nA page table is a data structure that the CPU uses to translate a virtual\naddress to a physical address, that is, from a page to a frame. The page table\nformat is dictated by the x86-64 architecture. Pintos provides page table\nmanagement code in threads/mmu.c.\nThe diagram below illustrates the relationship between pages and frames. The\nvirtual address, on the left, consists of a page number and an offset. The page\ntable translates the page number into a frame number, which is combined with the\nunmodified offset to obtain the physical address, on the right.\n                          +----------+\n         .--------------->|Page Table|-----------.\n        /                 +----------+            |\n        |   12 11 0                               V  12 11 0\n    +---------+----+                         +---------+----+\n    | Page Nr | Ofs|                         |Frame Nr | Ofs|\n    +---------+----+                         +---------+----+\n     Virt Addr   |                            Phys Addr    ^\n                  \\_______________________________________/\nSwap Slots\nA swap slot is a page-size region of disk space in the swap\npartition. Although hardware limitations dictating the placement\nof slots are more flexible than for frames, swap slots should be\npage-aligned because there is no downside in doing so.\nResource Management Overview\nYou will need to design/implement the following data structures:\nSupplemental page table\n\nEnables page fault handling by supplementing the page table.\nSee Managing the Supplemental Page Table below.\n\nFrame table\n\nAllows efficient implementation of eviction policy of physical frames\nSee Managing the Frame Table below.\n\nSwap table\n\nTracks usage of swap slots. See Managing the Swap Table below.\n\nYou do not necessarily need to implement three completely distinct data\nstructures: it may be convenient to wholly or partially merge related resources\ninto a unified data structure.\nFor each data structure, you need to determine what information each element\nshould contain. You also need to decide on the data structure's scope, either\nlocal (per-process) or global (applying to the whole system), and how many\ninstances are required within its scope.\nTo simplify your design, you may store these data structures in non-pageable\nmemory (e.g., memory allocated by calloc or malloc). That means that you can be sure that pointers among them will remain valid.\nChoices of implementation (Performance perspective)\nPossible choices for implementation include arrays, lists, bitmaps, and hash\ntables. An array is often the simplest approach, but a sparsely populated array\nwastes memory. Lists are also simple, but traversing a long list to find\na particular position wastes time. Both arrays and lists can be resized, but lists\nmore efficiently support insertion and deletion in the middle.\nPintos includes a bitmap data structure in lib/kernel/bitmap.c and\ninclude/lib/kernel/bitmap.h. A bitmap is an array of bits, each of which can be true\nor false. Bitmaps are typically used to track usage in a set of (identical)\nresources: if resource n is in use, then bit n of the bitmap is true.\nPintos bitmaps are fixed in size, although you could extend their implementation\nto support resizing.\nPintos also includes a hash table data structure (See\nHash Table). Pintos hash tables efficiently support\ninsertions and deletions over a wide range of table sizes.\nAlthough more complex data structures may yield better performance or other benefits,\nthey may also needlessly complicate your implementation. Thus, we do not\nrecommend implementing any advanced data structure (e.g. a balanced binary tree)\nas part of your design.\nManaging the Supplemental Page Table\nThe supplemental page table supplements the page table with additional\ndata about each page. It is needed because of the limitations imposed by the\npage table's format. Such a data structure is often called a \"page table\" also;\nwe add the word \"supplemental\" to reduce confusion.\nThe supplemental page table is used for at least two purposes. Most importantly,\non a page fault, the kernel looks up the virtual page that faulted in the\nsupplemental page table to find out what data should be there. Second, the\nkernel consults the supplemental page table when a process terminates, to decide\nwhat resources to free.\nOrganization of Supplemental Page Table\nYou may organize the supplemental page table as you wish. There are at least two\nbasic approaches to its organization: in terms of segments or in terms of pages.\nA segment here refers to a consecutive group of pages, i.e., memory region\ncontaining an executable or a memory-mapped file.\nOptionally, you may use the page table itself to track the members\nof the supplemental page table. You will have to modify the Pintos page table\nimplementation in threads/mmu.c to do so. We recommend this approach for\nadvanced students only.\nHandling page fault\nThe most important user of the supplemental page table is the page fault\nhandler. In project 2, a page fault always indicated a bug in the kernel or a\nuser program. In project 3, this is no longer true. Now, a page fault might only\nindicate that the page must be brought in from a file or swap slot. You will have to\nimplement a more sophisticated page fault handler to handle these cases. The\npage fault handler, which is page_fault() in userprog/exception.c, calls\nyour page fault handler, vm_try_handle_fault() in vm/vm.c.\nYour page fault handler needs to do roughly the following:\n\nLocate the page that faulted in the supplemental page table. If the memory\nreference is valid, use the supplemental page table entry to locate the data\nthat goes in the page, which might be in the file system, or in a swap slot, or\nit might simply be an all-zero page. If you implement sharing (i.e., Copy-on-Write), the page's data\nmight even already be in a page frame, but not in the page table.\nIf the supplemental page table indicates that the user process should not\nexpect any data at the address it was trying to access, or if the page lies\nwithin kernel virtual memory, or if the access is an attempt to write to a\nread-only page, then the access is invalid. Any invalid access terminates the\nprocess and thereby frees all of its resources.\n\nObtain a frame to store the page. If you implement sharing, the data you need\nmay already be in a frame, in which case you must be able to locate that frame.\n\nFetch the data into the frame, by reading it from the file system or swap,\nzeroing it, etc. If you implement sharing, the page you need may already be in a\nframe, in which case no action is necessary in this step.\n\nPoint the page table entry for the faulting virtual address to the physical\npage. You can use the functions in threads/mmu.c.\n\n\nManaging the Frame Table\nThe frame table contains one entry for each frame.\nEach entry in the frame table contains a pointer to the page, if any, that\ncurrently occupies it, and other data of your choice. The frame table allows\nPintos to efficiently implement an eviction policy, by choosing a page to evict\nwhen no frames are free.\nThe frames used for user pages should be obtained from the \"user pool,\" by\ncalling palloc_get_page(PAL_USER). You must use PAL_USER to avoid allocating\nfrom the \"kernel pool,\" which could cause some test cases to fail unexpectedly.\nIf you modify palloc.c as part of your frame table implementation, be sure to\nretain the distinction between the two pools.\nThe most important operation on the frame table is obtaining an unused frame.\nThis is easy when a frame is free. When none is free, a frame must be made free\nby evicting some page from its frame.\nIf no frame can be evicted without allocating a swap slot, but swap is full,\npanic the kernel. Real OSes apply a wide range of policies to recover from or\nprevent such situations, but these policies are beyond the scope of this\nproject.\nThe process of eviction comprises roughly the following steps:\n\nChoose a frame to evict, using your page replacement algorithm. The\n\"accessed\" and \"dirty\" bits in the page table, described below, will come in\nhandy.\n\nRemove references to the frame from any page table that refers to it. Unless\nyou have implemented sharing, only a single page should refer to a frame at any\ngiven time.\n\nIf necessary, write the page to the file system or to swap. The evicted frame\nmay then be used to store a different page.\n\n\nAccessed and Dirty Bits\nx86-64 hardware provides some assistance for implementing page replacement\nalgorithms, through a pair of bits in the page table entry (PTE) for each page.\nOn any read or write to a page, the CPU sets the accessed bit to 1 in the page's\nPTE, and on any write, the CPU sets the dirty bit to 1. The CPU never\nresets these bits to 0, but the OS may do so.\nYou need to be aware of aliases, that is, two (or more) pages that refer to\nthe same frame. When an aliased frame is accessed, the accessed and dirty bits\nare updated in only one page table entry (the one for the page used for access).\nThe accessed and dirty bits for the other aliases are not updated.\nIn Pintos, every user virtual page is aliased to its kernel virtual page. You\nmust manage these aliases somehow. For example, your code could check and update\nthe accessed and dirty bits for both addresses. Alternatively, the kernel could\navoid the problem by only accessing user data through the user virtual address.\nOther aliases should only arise if you implement sharing or if\nthere is a bug in your code.\nSee Section Page Table Accessed and Dirty Bits for\ndetails of the functions to work with accessed and dirty bits.\nManaging the Swap Table\nThe swap table tracks in-use and free swap slots. It should allow picking an\nunused swap slot for evicting a page from its frame to the swap partition. It\nshould allow freeing a swap slot when its page is read back or the process whose\npage was swapped is terminated.\nFrom the\nvm/build directory, use the command pintos-mkdisk swap.dsk --swap-size=n to\ncreate a disk named swap.dsk that contains a n-MB swap partition. Afterward,\nswap.dsk will automatically be attached as an extra disk when you run pintos.\nAlternatively, you can tell pintos to use a temporary n-MB swap disk for a\nsingle run with --swap-size=n.\nSwap slots should be allocated lazily, that is, only when they are actually\nrequired by eviction. Reading data pages from the executable and writing them to\nswap immediately at process startup is not lazy. Swap slots should not be\nreserved to store particular pages.\nFree a swap slot when its contents are read back into a frame.\nManaging Memory Mapped Files\nThe file system is most commonly accessed with read and write system calls.\nA secondary interface is to \"map\" the file into virtual pages, using the mmap\nsystem call. The program can then use memory instructions directly on the file\ndata. Suppose file foo is 0x1000 bytes (4 kB, or one page) long. If foo is\nmapped into memory starting at address 0x5000, then any memory accesses to\nlocations 0x5000. . .0x5fff will access the corresponding bytes of foo.\nHere's a program that uses mmap to print a file to the console. It opens the\nfile specified on the command line, maps it at virtual address 0x10000000,\nwrites the mapped data to the console (fd 1), and unmaps the file.\n#include \n#include \nint main (int argc UNUSED, char *argv[])\n{\n  void *data = (void *) 0x10000000;                 /* Address at which to map. */\n  int fd = open (argv[1]);                          /* Open file. */\n  void *map = mmap (data, filesize (fd), 0, fd, 0); /* Map file. */\n  write (1, data, filesize (fd));                   /* Write file to console. */\n  munmap (map);                                     /* Unmap file (optional). */\n  return 0;\n}\n\nYour submission must be able to track what memory is used by memory mapped\nfiles. This is necessary to properly handle page faults in the mapped regions\nand to ensure that mapped files do not overlap any other segments within the\nprocess.\n"},"project3/vm_management.html":{"url":"project3/vm_management.html","title":"Memory Management","keywords":"","body":"Memory Management\nIn order to support your virtual memory system, you need to effectively\nmanage virtual pages and physical frames. This means that you have to keep track\nof which (virtual or physical) memory regions are being used, for what purpose,\nby whom, and so on. You will first deal with supplemental page table, then\nphysical frames. Note that, for your understanding, we use the term \"page\" for\nvirtual page, and the term \"frame\" for a physical page.\nPage Structure and Operations\nstruct page\nA page defined in include/vm/vm.h is a structure that represents a page in\nvirtual memory. It stores all the necessary data that we need to know about the\npage. Currently, the structure looks like the following in the template:\nstruct page {\n  const struct page_operations *operations;\n  void *va;              /* Address in terms of user space */\n  struct frame *frame;   /* Back reference for frame */\n\n  union {\n    struct uninit_page uninit;\n    struct anon_page anon;\n    struct file_page file;\n#ifdef EFILESYS\n    struct page_cache page_cache;\n#endif\n  };\n};\n\nIt has page operations (read below), virtual address, and physical frame.\nAdditionally, it has a union field. A union is a special data type that\nallows us to store different types of data in a memory region.\nThere are multiple members in the union, but only one member can contain a value\nat a time. This means that a page in our system can be a uninit_page, anon_page,\nfile_page, or page_cache.\nFor example, if a page is an anonymous page (See Anonymous Page),\nthen the page struct will have the field struct anon_page anon as one of its\nmembers. anon_page will contain all the necessary information we need to keep\nfor an anonymous page.\nPage Operations\nAs described above and defined in include/vm/vm.h,\na page at can be VM_UNINIT, VM_ANON, or VM_FILE.\nFor a page, there are several actions to be taken, such as swapping in,\nswapping out, and destroying the page. For each type of page,\nthe required steps and tasks differ for these actions. In other words, a different destroy\nfunction needs to be invoked for a VM_ANON page and VM_FILE page. One way is\nuse a switch-case syntax in each function to handle each case. We introduce a\n\"class inheritance\" concept of Object-Oriented-Programming to deal it.\nIndeed, there is no \"class\" nor \"inheritance\" in C programming language, we\nutilizes function pointers\nto realize the concepts, in a similar way in real operating system codes like Linux.\nA function pointer is a pointer, just like any other pointers you've learned\nsofar, that points to a function, or an executable code within the memory.\nFunction pointers are useful because they provide a simple way to call a\nspecific function to execute based on run-time values without any checking.\nIn our case, simply calling destroy (page) is sufficient at code-level, and the\ncompiler will choose the appropriate destroy routine depending on the page type\nby calling the right function pointer.\nA structure for page operations struct page_operations is defined in\ninclude/vm/vm.h. Consider this structure as a table of functions, containing 3\nfunction pointers.\nstruct page_operations {\n  bool (*swap_in) (struct page *, void *);\n  bool (*swap_out) (struct page *);\n  void (*destroy) (struct page *);\n  enum vm_type type;\n};\n\nNow, let's see where we can find a page_operation structure. If you look into a\npage structure struct page in include/vm/vm.h, you see that it has a field\nnamed operations. Now, go to vm/file.c, you will see the page_operations\nstructure file_ops declared before the function prototypes. This is the table\nof function pointers for file-backed pages. .destroy field has value\nfile_backed_destroy, which is a function that destroys the page and is defined in\nthe same file.\nLet's try to understand how file_backed_destroy is invoked with the function\npointer interface. Suppose vm_dealloc_page (page) (in vm/vm.c) is called,\nand this page happens to be a file-backed page (VM_FILE). Inside the function,\nit invokes destroy (page). destroy (page) is defined with a macro in\ninclude/vm/vm.h like the following:\n#define destroy(page) if ((page)->operations->destroy) (page)->operations->destroy (page)\n\nThis tells us that calling destroy function actually invokes\n(page)->operations->destroy (page), which is the destroy function retrieved\nfrom the page structure. Because the page is a VM_FILE page, its .destroy\nfield points to file_backed_destory. As a result, destroy routine for file-backed\npage is performed.\nImplement Supplemental Page Table\nAt this point, your Pintos has a page table (pml4) to manage virtual and\nphysical mappings of memory. However, this is not enough. As discussion in the\nprevious section, you will also need a supplementary page table to hold additional\ninformation about each page in order to handle page fault and resource\nmanagement. Therefore, we suggest you to implement some basic functionalities\nfor the supplemental page table as the first task of project 3.\nImplement supplemental page table management functions in vm/vm.c.\nYou will first have to decide how you will design the supplemental page table in\nyour Pintos. After design your own supplemental page table, implements below\nthree functions with respect to your design.\n\nvoid supplemental_page_table_init (struct supplemental_page_table *spt);\n\n\nInitializes the supplemental page table. You may choose the data structure to\nuse for the supplemental page table. The function is called when a new process\nstarts (in initd of userprog/process.c) and when a process is being forked\n(in __do_fork of userprog/process.c).\n\n\nstruct page *spt_find_page (struct supplemental_page_table *spt, void *va);\n\n\nFind struct page that corresponds to va from the given supplemental page\ntable. If fail, return NULL.\n\n\nbool spt_insert_page (struct supplemental_page_table *spt, struct page *page);\n\n\nInsert struct page into the given supplemental page table. This function\nshould checks that the virtual address does not exist in the given\nsupplemental page table.\n\nFrame Management\nFrom now, all the pages are not just holding the meta-data for the memory when\nit was constructed. Therefore, we need a different scheme to manage the physical\nmemory. In include/vm/vm.h, there exists struct frame which represents a\nphysical memory. Currently, the structure looks like this:\n/* The representation of \"frame\" */\nstruct frame {\n  void *kva;\n  struct page *page;\n};\n\nIt only has two fields - kva which is the\nkernel virtual address and page which is a page structure.\nYou are allowed to add more members as you implement a frame management interface.\nImplement vm_get_frame, vm_claim_page and vm_do_claim_page in\nvm/vm.c.\n\nstatic struct frame *vm_get_frame (void);\n\n\nGets a new physical page from the user pool by calling palloc_get_page.\nWhen successfully got a page from the user pool, also allocates a frame,\ninitialize its members, and returns it.\nAfter you implement vm_get_frame, you have to allocate all user space pages\n(PALLOC_USER) through this function. You don't need to handle swap out for now\nin case of page allocation failure. Just mark those case with PANIC (\"todo\")\nfor now.\n\n\nbool vm_do_claim_page (struct page *page);\n\n\nClaims, meaning allocate a physical frame, a page. You first get a frame by\ncalling vm_get_frame (which is already done for you in the template).\nThen, you need to set up the MMU. In other words, add the mapping from the\nvirtual address to the physical address in the page table. The return value\nshould indicate whether the operation was successful or not.\n\n\nbool vm_claim_page (void *va);\n\n\nClaims the page to allocate va. You will first need to get a page and then\ncalls vm_do_claim_page with the page.\n\n"},"project3/anon.html":{"url":"project3/anon.html","title":"Anonymous Page","keywords":"","body":"Anonymous Page\nIn this part of this project, you will implement the non-disk based image\ncalled anonymous page.\nAn anonymous mapping has no backing file or device. It is anonymous\nbecause it does not have any named file source (unlike file-backed pages).\nAnonymous pages are used in executable, such as for stack and heap.\nThere is a struct to describe an anonymous page - anon_page in\ninclude/vm/anon.h. It is currently empty, but you may add members to store\nnecessary information or state of an anonymous page as you implement. Also, see\nthe struct page in include/vm/page.h, which contains generic information\nof a page. Note, for an anonymous page, struct anon_page anon is included in\nits page structure.\nPage Initialization with Lazy Loading\nLazy loading is a design where the loading of memory is deferred until the point\nat which it is needed. A page is allocated, meaning there is page struct\ncorresponding to it, but there is no dedicated physical frame, and the actual\ncontent of the page is not yet loaded. The contents will be loaded only at which\nit is truly needed, which is signaled by a page fault.\nSince we have three page types, the initialization routine is different for each\npage. Though will be explained again in the sections below, here we provide a\nhigh-level view of the page initialization flow. First,\nvm_alloc_page_with_initializer is invoked when the kernel receives a new page\nrequest. The initializer will initialize a new page by allocating a page\nstructure and setting appropriate initializer depending on its page type, and\nreturn the control back to the user program. As the user program executes, at a\npoint, a page fault occurs because the program is trying to access a page which\nit believes to possess but the page has no contents yet. During the fault\nhandling procedure, uninit_initialize is invoked and calls the initializer you\nset earlier. The initializer will be anon_initializer for anonymous pages and\nfile_backed_initializer for file-backed pages.\nA page can have a life cycle of\ninitialize->(page_fault->lazy-load->swap-in>swap-out->...)->destroy.\nFor each transition of the life cycle, the required procedure differs\ndepending on the page type (or VM_TYPE), and the previous paragraph\nwas an example for the initialization. In this project, you will implement\nthese transition processes for each page type.\nLazy Loading for Executable\nIn lazy loading, when a process starts it execution, only\nthe memory parts that are immediately needed are loaded onto the main memory.\nThis can reduce the overhead compared to eager loading, which loads all binary\nimage into the memory at once.\nTo support the lazy loading, we introduce a page type called VM_UNINIT in\ninclude/vm/vm.h. All pages are initially created as VM_INIT pages. We also\nprovide a page structure for uninitialized pages - struct uninit_page in\ninclude/vm/uninit.h. The functions for creating, initializing, and destroying\nuninitialized pages can be found in include/vm/uninit.c. You will have to\ncomplete these functions later.\nOn page fault, the page fault handler (page_fault in userprog/exception.c)\ntransfers control to vm_try_handle_fault in vm/vm.c, which first checks if\nit is a valid page fault. By valid, we mean the fault that accesses invalid.\nIf it is a bogus fault, you load some contents into the page and return\ncontrol to the user program.\nThere are three cases of bogus page fault: lazy-loaded, swaped-out page, and\nwrite-protected page (See Copy-on-Write (Extra)). For now, just\nconsider the first case, lazy-loaded page. If it is a page fault for lazy\nloading, the kernel calls one of the initializers you previously set in\nvm_alloc_page_with_initializer to lazy load the segment. You will have to\nimplement lazy_load_segment in userprog/process.c.\nImplement vm_alloc_page_with_initializer().\nYou should fetch an appropriate initializer according to the passed vm_type and\ncall uninit_new with it.\n\nbool vm_alloc_page_with_initializer (enum vm_type type, void *va,\n        bool writable, vm_initializer *init, void *aux);\n\n\nCreate an uninitialized page with the given type. The swap_in handler of uninit\npage automatically initializes the page according to the type, and calls\nINIT with given AUX. Once you have the page struct, insert the page into\nthe process's supplementary page table. Using VM_TYPE macro defined in\nvm.h can be handy.\n\nThe page fault handler follows its call chain, and finally reaches\nuninit_intialize when it calls swap_in. We gives the complete implementation\nfor it. Although, you may need to modify the uninit_initialize according to\nyour design.\n\nstatic bool uninit_initialize (struct page *page, void *kva);\n\n\nInitializes the page on the first fault. The template code first fetches\nvm_initializer and aux and calls the corresponding page_initializer\nthrough a function pointer. You may need to modify the function depending\non your design.\n\nYou may modify vm_anon_init and anon_initializer in vm/anon.c according\nto your needs.\n\nvoid vm_anon_init (void);\n\n\nInitialize for anonymous page subsystem. In this function, you can setup\nanything related to the anonymous page.\n\n\nbool anon_initializer (struct page *page,enum vm_type type, void *kva);\n\n\nThe function first sets up the handlers for the anonymous page in\npage->operations. You might need to update some information in anon_page,\nwhich is currently an empty struct. This function is used as initializer for\nanonymous pages (i.e. VM_ANON).\n\nImplement load_segment and lazy_load_segment in userprog/process.c.\nImplement segment loading from executables. All of these pages should be\nloaded lazily, that is, only as the kernel intercepts page faults for them.\nYou'll need to modify the core of the program loader, which is the loop in\nload_segment of userprog/process.c. Each time around the loop, it makes a\ncall to vm_alloc_page_with_initializer to create a pending page object.\nWhen a page fault occurs, this is when the segment is actually loaded from the\nfile.\n\nstatic bool load_segment (struct file *file, off_t ofs, uint8_t *upage,\n        uint32_t read_bytes, uint32_t zero_bytes, bool writable);\n\n\nCurrent code calculates the number of bytes to read from a file and the number\nof bytes to fill with zeros within the main loop. Then, it calls\nvm_alloc_page_with_initializer to create a pending object. You need to set\nup the auxiliary values as aux argument that you will provide to\nvm_alloc_page_with_initializer. You may want to create a structure that\ncontains necessary information for the loading of binary.\n\n\nstatic bool lazy_load_segment (struct page *page, void *aux);\n\n\nYou may have noticed that lazy_load_segment is supplied as the fourth\nargument of vm_alloc_page_with_initializer in load_segment. This function\nis the initializer for executable's pages and is invoked in times of page\nfaults. It receives a page struct and aux as arguments. aux is the\ninformation you set up in load_segment. Using this information, you have to\nfind the file to read the segment from and eventually read the segment into\nmemory.\n\nYou should adjust the setup_stack in userprog/process.c to fit stack\nallocation into the new memory management system. The first stack page need not be\nallocated lazily. You can allocate and initialize it with the command line\narguments at load time, with no need to wait for it to be faulted in. You might\nneed to provide the way to identify the stack. You can use the auxillary markers\nin vm_type of vm/vm.h (e.g. VM_MARKER_0) to mark the page.\nFinally, modify vm_try_handle_fault function to resolve the page struct\ncorresponding to the faulted address by consulting to the supplemental page\ntable through spt_find_page.\nAfter implementing all the requirements, all of the tests in project 2 except\nfork should be passed.\nSupplemental Page Table - Revisit\nNow, we revisit the supplemental page table interface to support copy and clean up operations.\nThese operations are needed when creating (more specifically generating a child process)\nor destroying a process. The details are elaborated below. The reason we are revisiting the\nsupplemental page table at this point is because you may want to use some of the\ninitializing functions you implemented from above.\nImplement supplemental_page_table_copy and supplemental_page_table_kill in\nvm/vm.c.\n\nbool supplemental_page_table_copy (struct supplemental_page_table *dst,\n    struct supplemental_page_table *src);\n\n\nCopies the supplemental page table from src to dst. This is used when a child\nneeds to inherit the execution context of its parent (i.e. fork()). Iterate\nthrough each page in the src's supplemental page table and make a exact copy\nof the entry in the dst's supplemental page table. You will need to allocate\nuninit page and claim them immediately.\n\n\nvoid supplemental_page_table_kill (struct supplemental_page_table *spt);\n\n\nFrees all the resources that were held by a supplemental page table.\nThis function is called when a process exits (process_exit() in\nuserprog/process.c). You need to iterate through the page entries and call\ndestroy(page) for the pages in the table. You do not need to worry about the\nactual page table (pml4) and the physical memory (palloc-ed memory) in this\nfunction; the caller cleans them after the supplemental page table is cleaned\nup.\n\nPage Cleanup\nImplement uninit_destroy in vm/uninit.c and anon_destroy in\nvm/anon.c. This is handler for destroy operation on uninitialized page.\nEven though uninitialized pages are transmuted to the other page objects, there\nstill can be uninit page when the process exits.\n\nstatic void uninit_destroy (struct page *page);\n\n\nFrees the resource that was held by page struct. You might\nwant to check the vm type of the page and handle accordingly.\n\nFor now, you can only handle the anonymous pages. You will later revisit this\nfunction to clean up the file-backed pages.\n\nstatic void anon_destroy (struct page *page);\n\n\nFrees the resource that was held by the anonymous page. You do not need to\nexplicitly free the page struct, the caller should do it.\n\nNow all of the tests in project 2 should be passed.\n"},"project3/stack_growth.html":{"url":"project3/stack_growth.html","title":"Stack Growth","keywords":"","body":"Stack Growth\nIn project 2, the stack was a single page starting from the USER_STACK, and\nprograms' executions were limited to this size. Now, if the stack grows past its\ncurrent size, we allocate additional pages as necessary.\nAllocate additional pages only if they \"appear\" to be stack accesses. Devise a\nheuristic that attempts to distinguish stack accesses from other accesses.\nUser programs are buggy if they write to the stack below the stack pointer,\nbecause typical real OSes may interrupt a process at any time to deliver a\n\"signal,\" which modifies data on the stack. However, the x86-64 PUSH instruction\nchecks access permissions before it adjusts the stack pointer, so it may cause a\npage fault 8 bytes below the stack pointer.\nYou will need to be able to obtain the current value of the user program's stack\npointer. Within a system call or a page fault generated by a user program, you\ncan retrieve it from the rsp member of the struct intr_frame passed to\nsyscall_handler() or page_fault(), respectively. If you depend on page\nfaults to detect invalid memory access, you will need to handle another case,\nwhere a page fault occurs in the kernel. Since the processor only saves\nthe stack pointer when an exception causes a switch from user to kernel mode,\nreading rsp out of the struct intr_frame passed to page_fault() would\nyield an undefined value, not the user stack pointer. You will need to arrange\nanother way, such as saving rsp into struct thread on the initial transition\nfrom user to kernel mode.\nImplement stack growth functionalities.\nTo implement this, you first modify vm_try_handle_fault in vm/vm.c to\nidentify the stack growth. After identifying the stack growth, you should make a\ncall to vm_stack_growth in vm/vm.c to grow the stack.

Unlike anonymous pages,\nmemory-mapped pages are file-backed mappings. The contents in the page mirror\ndata in some existing file. If a page fault occurs, a physical frame is\nimmediately allocated and the contents are copied into the memory from the file.\nWhen memory-mapped pages are unmapped or swapped out, any change in the content\nis reflected in the file.\nmmap and munmap System Call\nImplement mmap and munmap, which are the two system calls for memory\nmapped files. Your VM system must load pages lazily in mmap regions and use the\nmmaped file itself as a backing store for the mapping. You should implement and\nuse do_mmap and do_munmap defined in vm/file.c to implement these two\nsystem calls.\n\nvoid *mmap (void *addr, size_t length, int writable, int fd, off_t offset);\n\n\nMaps length bytes the file open as fd starting from offset byte into the\nprocess's virtual address space at addr.

If the length of the file is not\na multiple of PGSIZE, then some bytes in the final mapped page \"stick out\"\nbeyond the end of the file. Set these bytes to zero when the page is faulted\nin, and discard them when the page is written back to disk. If successful,\nthis function returns the virtual address where the file is mapped. On\nfailure, it must return NULL which is not a valid address to map a file.\n\nA call to mmap may fail if the file opened as fd has a length of zero bytes.\nIt must fail if addr is not page-aligned or if the range of pages mapped\noverlaps any existing set of mapped pages, including the stack or pages mapped\nat executable load time. In Linux, if addr is NULL, the kernel finds an\nappropriate address at which to create the mapping. For simplicity, you can just\nattempt to mmap at the given addr. Therefore, if addr is 0, it must fail,\nbecause some Pintos code assumes virtual page 0 is not mapped. Your mmap should\nalso fail when length is zero. Finally, the file descriptors representing\nconsole input and output are not mappable.\nMemory-mapped pages should be also allocated in a lazy manner just like\nanonymous pages. You can use vm_alloc_page_with_initializer or vm_alloc_page\nto make a page object.\n\nvoid munmap (void *addr);\n\n\nUnmaps the mapping for the specified address range addr, which must be the\nvirtual address returned by a previous call to mmap by the same process that\nhas not yet been unmapped.\n\nAll mappings are implicitly unmapped when a process exits, whether via exit or\nby any other means. When a mapping is unmapped, whether implicitly or\nexplicitly, all pages written to by the process are written back to the file,\nand pages not written must not be. The pages are then removed from the process's\nlist of virtual pages.\nClosing or removing a file does not unmap any of its mappings. Once created, a\nmapping is valid until munmap is called or the process exits, following the\nUnix convention. See Removing an Open File for more\ninformation. You should use the file_reopen function to obtain a separate and\nindependent reference to the file for each of its mappings.\nIf two or more processes map the same file, there is no requirement that they\nsee consistent data. Unix handles this by making the two mappings share the same\nphysical page, and the mmap system call also has an argument allowing the client\nto specify whether the page is shared or private (i.e. copy-on-write).\nYou may want to modify vm_file_init and vm_file_initializer in vm/vm.c\naccording to your needs.\n\nvoid vm_file_init (void);\n\n\nInitializes the file-backed page subsystem.

When frames of the main memory is allocated, the system cannot\nhandle any more memory allocation requests from user programs.

This frees\nsome memory resources and makes available to other applications.\nSwapping is done by the operating system. When the system detects that it has\nrun out of memory but receives a memory allocation request, it chooses a page to\nevict out to swap disk. Then, the exact state of the memory frame is copied to\nthe disk.

If some resource is\nbeing used by multiple processes, each process should usually have its own copy\nof the resource to make sure that no conflict occurs. If the resource is not\nmodified but just being read, however, there is no need to have multiple copies\nin the physical memory.\nFor example, suppose a new process is created through fork. The child needs to\ninherit its parent's resource by duplicating the data into its virtual address\nspace. Usually, adding contents to its virtual memory involves allocating a\nphysical page, writing the data into the frame, and adding a virtual->physical\nmapping in its page table. These steps can be quite time-consuming.\nWith copy-on-write technique, however, we do not allocate new physical page for\nthe new copy of resources. This is because, technically, the content already exists in the\nphysical memory. Therefore, we only add the virtual->physical mapping in the\nchild process's page table, where the virtual address is now in the child's memory space.\nThen, the parent and child are accessing the same\ndata in the same physical page. Yet, they are still isolated through separate\nvirtual address space, and only OS knows that they are referring to the same\nframe. Only when one of the process tries to modify the content of the shared\nresource, it will create a separate copy in a new physical page for itself.\nTherefore, the actual copy operation is deferred to the first write.\nThat is, OS needs to be able to detect write attempts on copy-on-write pages. To\nachieve this need, OS uses the \"write-protect\" mechanism. It is a simple\nidea: Make a page fault on write accesses. This can be easily implemented with\nthe support of the memory management system, by just marking write-protected\npage as unwritable at all.\nYou only need to implement copy-on-write for fork. When a child process\ninherits the resource from its parent process, the resource can be referencing\nto the same physical data until the child tries to modify it. All\nwrite-protected pages are candidates for eviction.\nWe only provide basic test cases for copy-on-write.

You can layer some other allocator on top of palloc_get_page() if\nyou like, but it should be the underlying mechanism.\nAlso, you can use the -ul kernel command-line option to limit the size of the\nuser pool, which makes it easy to test your VM implementation with various\nuser memory sizes.\n"},"project4/introduction.html":{"url":"project4/introduction.html","title":"Introduction","keywords":"","body":"Project 4: File Systems\nIn the previous two assignments, you made extensive use of a file system without\nactually worrying about how it was implemented underneath.

In either case, all of\nthe functionality needed for project 2 must work in your filesys submission. If\nyou build on project 3, then all of the project 3 functionality must work also,\nand you will need to edit filesys/Make.vars to enable VM functionality. We\nwill deduct 10% credit if you disable the VM.\nNote that the page cache (extra credit) requires the VM functionality.\nBackground\nNew Code\nHere are some files that are probably new to you.

Our file\nsystem has calls that are similar, but not identical, to these. The file system\ntranslates these calls into disk operations.\nAll the basic functionality is there in the code above, so that the file system is usable from\nthe start, as you've seen in the previous two projects. However, it has severe limitations\nwhich you will remove.\nWhile most of your work will be in filesys, you should be prepared for interactions\nwith all previous parts.\nTesting File System Persistence\nUntil now, each test invoked Pintos just once. However, an important purpose of a\nfile system is to ensure that data remains accessible from one boot to another. Thus, the\ntests that are part of the file system project invoke Pintos a second time. The second run\ncombines all the files and directories in the file system into a single file, then copies that file\nout of the Pintos file system into the host (Unix) file system.\nThe grading scripts check the file systems correctness based on the contents of the file\ncopied out in the second run. This means that your project will not pass any of the extended\nfile system tests until the file system is implemented well enough to support tar, the Pintos\nuser program that produces the file that is copied out. The tar program is fairly demanding\n(it requires both extensible file and subdirectory support), so this will take some work. Until\nthen, you can ignore errors from make check regarding the extracted file system.\nIncidentally, as you may have surmised, the file format used for copying out the file\nsystem contents is the standard Unix \"tar\" format. You can use the Unix tar program to\nexamine them. The tar file for test t is named t.tar.\n"},"project4/indexed_and_extensible_files.html":{"url":"project4/indexed_and_extensible_files.html","title":"Indexed and Extensible Files","keywords":"","body":"Indexed and Extensible Files\nThe basic file system allocates files as a single extent, making it vulnerable to external\nfragmentation, that is, it is possible that an n-block file cannot be allocated even though\nn blocks are free (i.e. external fragmentation). Eliminate this problem by modifying the\non-disk inode structure.\nIn practice, this probably means using an index structure with direct, indirect, and doubly\nindirect blocks. In previous semesters, most students adopted something like what you have\nlearned as Berkeley UNIX FFS with multi-level indexing. However, to make your life easier,\nwe make you implement it in an easier way: FAT. You must implement FAT with given skeleton code.\nYour code MUST NOT contain any code for multi-level indexing (FFS in the lecture).\nYou will receive 0pts for file growth parts.\nNOTE: You can assume that the file system partition will not be larger than 8 MB. You must\nsupport files as large as the partition (minus metadata). Each inode is stored in one disk\nsector, limiting the number of block pointers that it can contain.\nIndexing large files with FAT (File Allocation Table)\n\nWarning: this document assumes you have already understood the basic principle of \ngeneral filesystem and FAT from the lecture. If not, please go back to the lecture note\nand understand what is filesystem and FAT.\n\nIn the basic filesystem that you have used for the previous projects, a file was stored as a\ncontiguous single chunk over multiple disk sectors. Let's call contiguous chunk as cluster,\nsince a cluster (chunk) can contain one or more contiguous disk sectors. In this point of view,\nthe size of a cluster in the basic file system was equal to the size of a file that stored in the\ncluster.\nTo mitigate external fragmentation, we can shrink the size of cluster (recall the page size in\nvirtual memory). For simplicity, in our skeleton code, we fixed number of sectors in a cluster\nas 1. When we use smaller clusters like it, a cluster might not enough to store the entire file.\nIn this case, we need multiple clusters for a file, so we need a data structure to index the clusters\nfor a file in the inode. One of the easiest way is to use linked-list (a.k.a chain). An inode\ncan contain the sector number of the first block of the file, and the first block\nmay contain the sector number of the second block. This naïve approach, however, is too slow\nbecause we have to read every block of the file, even though what we really need was only the\nlast block. To overcome this, FAT (File Allocation Table) puts the connectivity of blocks in\na fixed-size File Allocation Table rather than the blocks themselves. Since FAT only contains the\nconnectivity value rather than the actual data, its size is small enough to be cached in DRAM.\nAs a result, we can just read corresponding entries in the table.\nYou will implement inode indexing with the skeleton code provided in filesys/fat.c. This\nsection briefly describes what already-implemented functions in fat.c do and what you\nshould implement.\nFirst of all, 6 functions in fat.c (i.e. fat_init(), fat_open(), fat_close(), fat_create(),\nand fat_boot_create()) initialize and format disks at the boot time, so you don't\nhave to modify them. However, you'll need to write fat_fs_init(), and briefly understanding what they\ndo could be helpful.\n\ncluster_t fat_fs_init (void);\n\n\nInitialize FAT file system. You have to initialize fat_length and data_start field of fat_fs.\nfat_length stores how many clusters in the filesystem and data_start stores in which sector\nwe can start to store files. You may want to exploit some values stored in fat_fs->bs.\nAlso, you may want to initialize some other useful data in this function.\n\n\ncluster_t fat_create_chain (cluster_t clst);\n\n\nExtend a chain by appending a cluster after the cluster specified in clst (cluster indexing number).\nIf clst is equal to zero, then create a new chain. Return the cluster number of newly allocated cluster.\n\n\nvoid fat_remove_chain (cluster_t clst, cluster_t pclst);\n\n\nStarting from clst, remove clusters from a chain. pclst should be the direct previous cluster in the chain.\nThis means, after the execution of this function, pclst should be the last element of the updated chain.\nIf clst is the first element in the chain, pclst should be 0.\n\n\nvoid fat_put (cluster_t clst, cluster_t val);\n\n\nUpdate FAT entry pointed by cluster number clst to val. Since each entry in FAT points the next\ncluster in a chain (if exist; otherwise EOChain), this could be used to update connectivity.\n\n\ncluster_t fat_get (cluster_t clst);\n\n\nReturn in which cluster number the given cluster clst points.\n\n\ndisk_sector_t cluster_to_sector (cluster_t clst);\n\n\nTranslates a cluster number clst into the corresponding sector number and return the sector number.\n\n\nYou may wish to exploit these functions in filesys.c and inode.c to augment the basic file system.\nFile Growth\nImplement extensible files. In the basic file system, the file\nsize is specified when the file is created. In most modern file systems, however, a file is\ninitially created with size 0 and is then expanded every time a write is made off the end of\nthe file. Your file system must allow this.\nThere should be no predetermined limit on the size of a file, except that a file cannot\nexceed the size of the file system (minus metadata). This also applies to the root directory\nfile, which should now be allowed to expand beyond its initial limit of 16 files.\nUser programs are allowed to seek beyond the current end-of-file (EOF). The seek itself\ndoes not extend the file. Writing at a position past EOF extends the file to the position\nbeing written, and any gap between the previous EOF and the start of the write must be\nfilled with zeros. A read starting from a position past EOF returns no bytes.\nWriting far beyond EOF can cause many blocks to be entirely zero. Some file systems\nallocate and write real data blocks for these implicitly zeroed blocks. Other file systems do\nnot allocate these blocks at all until they are explicitly written. The latter file systems are\nsaid to support \"sparse files.\" You may adopt either allocation strategy in your file system.\n"},"project4/subdirectories.html":{"url":"project4/subdirectories.html","title":"Subdirectories and Soft Links","keywords":"","body":"Subdirectories\nImplement a hierarchical name space.\nIn the basic file system, all files live in a single directory. Modify this to\nallow directory entries to point to files or to other directories.\nMake sure that directories can expand beyond their original size just as any other file\ncan.\nThe basic file system has a 14-character limit on file names. You may retain this limit\nfor individual file name components, or may extend it, at your option. You must allow full\npath names to be much longer than 14 characters.\nMaintain a separate current directory for each process.\nAt startup, set the root as the initial process's current directory. When one\nprocess starts another with the fork system call, the child process inherits its\nparent's current directory. After that, the two processes' current directories\nare independent, so that either changing its own current directory has no effect\non the other. (This is why, under Unix, the cd command is a shell built-in, not\nan external program.)\nUpdate the existing system calls so that, anywhere a file name is provided by\nthe caller, an absolute or relative path name may used. The directory separator\ncharacter is forward slash ('/'). You must also support special file names '.'\nand '..', which have the same meanings as they do in Unix.\nUpdate the open system call so that it can also open directories. Of the\nexisting system calls, only close needs to accept a file descriptor for a\ndirectory.\nUpdate the remove system call so that it can delete empty directories (other\nthan the root) in addition to regular files. Directories may only be deleted if\nthey do not contain any files or subdirectories (other than '.' and '..'). You may decide whether to allow deletion\nof a directory that is open by a process or in use as a processs current working directory.\nIf it is allowed, then attempts to open files (including '.' and '..') or create new files in a\ndeleted directory must be disallowed.\nImplement the following new system calls:\n\nbool chdir (const char *dir);\n\n\nChanges the current working directory of the process to dir, which may be relative\nor absolute. Returns true if successful, false on failure.\n\n\nbool mkdir (const char *dir);\n\n\nCreates the directory named dir, which may be relative or absolute. Returns true if\nsuccessful, false on failure. Fails if dir already exists or if any directory name in dir,\nbesides the last, does not already exist. That is, mkdir(\"/a/b/c\") succeeds only if /a/b already exists and /a/b/c does not.\n\n\nbool readdir (int fd, char *name);\n\n\nReads a directory entry from file descriptor fd, which must represent a directory. If\nsuccessful, stores the null-terminated file name in name, which must have room for\nREADDIR_MAX_LEN + 1 bytes, and returns true. If no entries are left in the directory,\nreturns false.\n. and .. should not be returned by readdir.\nIf the directory changes while it is open, then it is acceptable for some entries not to\nbe read at all or to be read multiple times. Otherwise, each directory entry should\nbe read once, in any order.\nREADDIR_MAX_LEN is defined in lib/user/syscall.h. If your file system supports\nlonger file names than the basic file system, you should increase this value from the\ndefault of 14.\n\n\nbool isdir (int fd);\n\n\nReturns true if fd represents a directory, false if it represents an ordinary file.\n\n\nint inumber (int fd);\n\n\nReturns the inode number of the inode associated with fd, which may represent an ordinary file or a directory.\nAn inode number persistently identifies a file or directory. It is unique during the\nfiles existence. In Pintos, the sector number of the inode is suitable for use as an inode number.\n\nSoft Link\nImplement the soft link machanism in pintos.\nSoft link (aka. Symbolic link) is a pseudo file object that refers another file\nor directory. This file contains information of path of pointed file in terms of\nabsolute or relative path. Let's assume the following situation:\n/\n├── a\n│   ├── link1 -> /file\n│   │\n│   └── link2 -> ../file\n└── file\nThe soft-link named link1 in /a points /file (as an absolute path),\nand link2 in /a points ../file (as a relative path).\nReading the link1 or link2 file is equivalent to reading /file.\n\nint symlink (const char *target, const char *linkpath);\n\n\nCreates a symbolic link named linkpath which contains the string target.\nOn success, zero is returned. Otherwise, -1 is returned.\n\n"},"project4/buffer_cache.html":{"url":"project4/buffer_cache.html","title":"Buffer Cache (Extra)","keywords":"","body":"Buffer Cache (Extra Credit)\nModify the file system to keep a cache of file blocks. When a request is made to read or\nwrite a block, check to see if it is in the cache, and if so, use the cached data without\ngoing to disk. Otherwise, fetch the block from disk into the cache, evicting an older entry\nif necessary. You are limited to a cache no greater than 64 sectors in size.\nYou must implement a cache replacement algorithm that is at least as good as the\n\"clock\" algorithm. We encourage you to account for the generally greater value\nof metadata compared to data. Experiment to see what combination of accessed,\ndirty, and other information results in the best performance, as measured by the\nnumber of disk accesses.\nYou can keep a cached copy of the free map permanently in memory if you like. It\ndoesn't have to count against the cache size.\nThe provided inode code uses a \"bounce buffer\" allocated with malloc() to translate\nthe disk's sector-by-sector interface into the system call interface's byte-by-byte interface.\nYou should get rid of these bounce buffers. Instead, copy data into and out of sectors in\nthe buffer cache directly.\nYour cache should be write-behind, that is, keep dirty blocks in the cache, instead of\nimmediately writing modified data to disk. Write dirty blocks to disk whenever they are\nevicted. Because write-behind makes your file system more fragile in the face of crashes,\nin addition you should periodically write all dirty, cached blocks back to disk. The cache\nshould also be written back to disk in filesys_done(), so that halting Pintos flushes the\ncache.\nIf you have timer_sleep() from the first project working, write-behind is an excellent\napplication. Otherwise, you may implement a less general facility, but make sure that it\ndoes not exhibit busy-waiting.\nYou should also implement read-ahead, that is, automatically fetch the next block of\na file into the cache when one block of a file is read, in case that block is about to be\nread. Read-ahead is only really useful when done asynchronously. That means, if a process\nrequests disk block 1 from the file, it should block until disk block 1 is read in, but once\nthat read is complete, control should return to the process immediately. The read-ahead\nrequest for disk block 2 should be handled asynchronously, in the background.\nTo do so, you might need to create a dedicated thread for the IO. When the disk\nIO needs, the thread passes the request to the dedicated one.\nHint for implementation\nYou might implement this functionality through the virtual memory subsystem as\nLinux does. You can introduce new vm type (e.g. \"pagecache\") and manage\nthe buffer cache through the swap_in, swap_out, and destroy interfaces.\nIf you choose this design, you can manage the cache with a PAGE_SIZE granularity\nrather than SECTOR_SIZE granularity.\nFor the synchronization issue for file backed page, you can use the mmaped area\nas a cache for them.\nWe recommend integrating the cache into your design early. In the past, many\ngroups have tried to tack the cache onto a design late in the design process.\nThis is very difficult. These groups have often turned in projects that failed\nmost or all of the tests.\n"},"project4/synchronization.html":{"url":"project4/synchronization.html","title":"Synchronization","keywords":"","body":"Synchronization\nThe provided file system requires external synchronization, that is, callers must ensure that\nonly one thread can be running in the file system code at once.

In particular, when I/O is\nrequired on a particular block, operations on other blocks that do not require I/O should\nproceed without having to wait for the I/O to complete.\nMultiple processes must be able to access a single file at once. Multiple reads of a single\nfile must be able to complete without waiting for one another.

See Page Tables.\n\n\nunsigned magic\n\n\nAlways set to THREAD_MAGIC, which is just an arbitrary number defined in\nthreads/thread.c, and used to detect stack overflow. thread_current()\nchecks that the magic member of the running thread's struct thread is set\nto THREAD_MAGIC. Stack overflow tends to change this value, triggering the\nassertion. For greatest benefit, as you add members to struct thread, leave\nmagic at the end.\n\nThread Functions\nthreads/thread.c implements several public functions for thread support.\nLet's take a look at the most useful:\n\nvoid thread_init (void);\n\n\nCalled by main() to initialize the thread system. Its main purpose is to\ncreate a struct thread for Pintos's initial thread. This is possible because\nthe Pintos loader puts the initial thread's stack at the top of a page, in the\nsame position as any other Pintos thread.\nBefore thread_init() runs, thread_current() will fail because the running\nthread's magic value is incorrect. Lots of functions call thread_current()\ndirectly or indirectly, including lock_acquire() for locking a lock, so\nthread_init() is called early in Pintos initialization.\n\n\nvoid thread_start (void);\n\n\nCalled by main() to start the scheduler. Creates the idle thread, that is,\nthe thread that is scheduled when no other thread is ready. Then enables\ninterrupts, which as a side effect enables the scheduler because the scheduler\nruns on return from the timer interrupt, using intr_yield_on_return().\n\n\nvoid thread_tick (void);\n\n\nCalled by the timer interrupt at each timer tick. It keeps track of thread\nstatistics and triggers the scheduler when a time slice expires.\n\n\nvoid thread_print_stats (void);\n\n\nCalled during Pintos shutdown to print thread statistics.\n\n\ntid_t thread_create (const char *name, int priority, thread func *func, void *aux);\n\n\nCreates and starts a new thread named name with the given priority, returning\nthe new thread's tid. The thread executes func, passing aux as the function's\nsingle argument.\nthread_create() allocates a page for the thread's struct thread and stack\nand initializes its members, then it sets up a set of fake stack frames for\nit. The thread is initialized in the blocked state, then unblocked just before\nreturning, which allows the new thread to be scheduled.\n\n\nvoid thread_func (void *aux);\n\n\nThis is the type of the function passed to thread_create(), whose aux\nargument is passed along as the function's argument.\n\n\nvoid thread_block (void);\n\n\nTransitions the running thread from the running state to the blocked state.\nThe thread will not run again until thread_unblock() is called on it, so\nyou'd better have some way arranged for that to happen. Because\nthread_block() is so low-level, you should prefer to use one of the\nsynchronization primitives instead\n(see Synchronization).\n\n\nvoid thread_unblock (struct thread *thread);\n\n\nTransitions thread, which must be in the blocked state, to the ready state,\nallowing it to resume running. This is called when the event that the thread\nis waiting for occurs, e.g. when the lock that the thread is waiting on\nbecomes available.\n\n\nstruct thread *thread_current (void);\n\n\nReturns the running thread.\n\n\ntid_t thread_tid (void);\n\n\nReturns the running thread's thread id.\nEquivalent to thread_current ()->tid.\n\n\nconst char *thread_name (void);\n\n\nReturns the running thread's name. Equivalent to thread_current ()->name.\n\n\nvoid thread_exit (void) NO_RETURN;\n\n\nCauses the current thread to exit. Never returns.\n\n\nvoid thread_yield (void);\n\n\nYields the CPU to the scheduler, which picks a new thread to run. The new\nthreadmight be the current thread, so you can't depend on this function to\nkeep this thread from running for any particular length of time.\n\n\nint thread_get_priority (void);\nvoid thread_set_priority (int new_priority);\n\n\nStub to set and get thread priority. See\nPriority Scheduling.\n\n\nint thread_get_nice (void);\nvoid thread_set_nice (int new_nice);\nint thread_get_recent_cpu (void);\nint thread_get_load_avg (void);\n\n\nStubs for the advanced scheduler.\n\n"},"appendix/synchronization.html":{"url":"appendix/synchronization.html","title":"Synchronization","keywords":"","body":"Synchronization\nIf sharing of resources between threads is not handled in a careful,\ncontrolled fasion, the result is usually a big mess. This is especially the case\nin operating system kernels, where faulty sharing can crash the entire machine.\nPintos provides several synchronization primitives to help out.\nDisabling Interrupts\nThe crudest way to do synchronization is to disable interrupts, that is, to\ntemporarily prevent the CPU from responding to interrupts. If interrupts are\noff, no other thread will preempt the running thread, because thread preemption\nis driven by the timer interrupt. If interrupts are on, as they normally are,\nthen the running thread may be preempted by another at any time, whether between\ntwo C statements or even within the execution of one.\nIncidentally, this means that Pintos is a \"preemptible kernel,\" that is, kernel\nthreads can be preempted at any time. Traditional Unix systems are\n\"nonpreemptible,\" that is, kernel threads can only be preempted at points where\nthey explicitly call into the scheduler. (User programs can be preempted at any\ntime in both models.) As you might imagine, preemptible kernels require more\nexplicit synchronization.\nYou should have little need to set the interrupt state directly. Most of the\ntime you should use the other synchronization primitives described in the\nfollowing sections. The main reason to disable interrupts is to synchronize\nkernel threads with external interrupt handlers, which cannot sleep and thus\ncannot use most other forms of synchronization.\nSome external interrupts cannot be postponed, even by disabling interrupts.\nThese interrupts, called non-maskable interrupts (NMIs), are supposed to be\nused only in emergencies, e.g. when the computer is on fire. Pintos does not\nhandle non-maskable interrupts.\nTypes and functions for disabling and enabling interrupts are in\ninclude/threads/interrupt.h.\n\nenum intr_level;\n\n\nOne of INTR_OFF or INTR_ON, denoting that interrupts are disabled or\nenabled, resepectively.\n\n\nenum intr_level intr_get_level (void)\n\n\nReturns the current interrupt state.\n\n\nenum intr_level intr_set_level (enum intr_level level);\n\n\nTurns interrupts on or off according to level. Returns the previous interrupt\nstate.\n\n\nenum intr_level intr_enable (void);\n\n\nTurns interrupts on. Returns the previos interrupt state.\n\n\nenum intr_level intr_disable (void);\n\n\nTurns interrupts off. Returns the previous interrupt state.\n\nSemaphores\nA semaphore is a nonnegative interger together with two operators that\nmanipulate it atomically, which are:\n\n\"Down\" or \"P\" : wait for the value to become positive, then decrement it.\n\"UP\" or \"V\": increment the value (and wake up one waiting thread, if any).\n\nA semaphore initialized to 0 may be used to wait for an event that will happen\nexactly once. For example, suppose thread A starts another thread B and wants to\nwait for B to signal that some activity is complete. A can create a semaphore\ninitialized to 0, pass it to B as it starts it, and then \"down\" the semaphore.\nWhen B finishes its activity, it \"ups\" the semaphore. This works regardless of\nwhether A \"downs\" the semaphore or B \"ups\" it first.\nFor example:\nstruct semaphore sema;\n\n/* Thread A */\nvoid threadA (void) {\n    sema_down (&sema);\n}\n\n/* Thread B */\nvoid threadB (void) {\n    sema_up (&sema);\n}\n\n/* main function */\nvoid main (void) {\n    sema_init (&sema, 0);\n    thread_create (\"threadA\", PRI_MIN, threadA, NULL);\n    thread_create (\"threadB\", PRI_MIN, threadB, NULL);\n}\n\nIn this example, threadA stops execution at sema_down () until threadB called\nsema_up ().\nA semaphore initialized to 1 is typically used for controlling access to a\nresource. Before a block of code starts using the resource, it \"downs\" the\nsemaphore, then after it is done with the resource it \"ups\" the resource. In\nsuch a case a lock, described below, may be more appropriate.\nSemaphores can also be initialized to values larger than 1. These are rarely\nused. Semaphores were invented by Edsger Dijkstra and first used in the THE\noperating system. Pintos' semaphore type and operations are declared in\ninclude/threads/synch.h.\n\nstruct semaphore;\n\n\nRepresents a semaphore.\n\n\nvoid sema_init (struct semaphore *sema, unsigned value);\n\n\nInitializes sema as a new semaphore with the given initial value.\n\n\nvoid sema_down (struct semaphore *sema);\n\nExecutes the \"down\" or \"P\" operation on sema, waiting for its value to become\npositive and then decrementing it by one.\n\nbool sema_try_down (struct semaphore *sema);\n\n\nTries to execute the \"down\" or \"P\" operation on sema, without waiting. Returns\ntrue if sema was successfully decremented, or false if it was already zero and\nthus could not be decremented without waiting. Calling this function in a\ntight loop wastes CPU time, so use sema_down() or find a different approach\ninstead.\n\n\nvoid sema_up (struct semaphore *sema);\n\n\nExecutes the \"up\" or \"V\" operation on sema, incrementing its value. If any\nthreads are waiting on sema, wakes one of them up. Unlike most synchronization\nprimitives, sema_up() may be called inside an external interrupt handler.\n\nSemaphores are internally built out of disabling interrupt\n(see Disabling Interrupts) and thread blocking and\nunblocking (thread_block() and thread_unblock()). Each semaphore maintains\na list of waiting threads, using the linked list implementation in\nlib/kernel/list.c.\nLocks\nA lock is like a semaphore with an initial value of 1\n(see Semaphores). A lock's equivalent of \"up\" is called\n\"release\", and the \"down\" operation is called \"acquire\".\nCompared to a semaphore, a lock has one added restriction: only the trhead that\nacquires a lock, called the lock's \"owner\", is allowed to release it. If this\nrestriction is a problem, it's a good sign that a semaphore should be used,\ninstead of a lock.\nLocks in Pintos are not \"recursive,\" that is, it is an error for the thread\ncurrently holding a lock to try to acquire that lock.\nLock types and functions are declared in include/threads/synch.h.\n\nstruct lock;\n\n\nRepresents a lock.\n\n\nvoid lock_init (struct lock *lock);\n\n\nInitializes lock as a new lock. The lock is not initially owned by any thread.\n\n\nvoid lock_acquire (struct lock *lock);\n\n\nAcquires lock for the current thread, first waiting for any current owner to\nrelease it if necessary.\n\n\nbool lock_try_acquire (struct lock *lock);\n\n\nTries to acquire lock for use by the current thread, without waiting. Returns\ntrue if successful, false if the lock is already owned. Calling this function\nin a tight loop is a bad idea because it wastes CPU time, so use\nlock_acquire() instead.\n\n\nvoid lock_release (struct lock *lock);\n\n\nReleases lock, which the current thread must own.\n\n\nbool lock_held_by_current_thread (const struct lock *lock):\n\n\nReturns true if the running thread owns lock, false otherwise. There is no\nfunction to test whether an arbitrary thread owns a lock, because the answer\ncould change before the caller could act on it.\n\nMonitors\nA monitor is a higher-level form of synchronization than a semaphore or a lock.\nA monitor consists of data being synchronized, plus a lock, called the monitor\nlock, and one or more condition variables. Before it accesses the protected\ndata, a thread first acquires the monitor lock. It is then said to be\n\"in the monitor\". While in the monitor, the thread has control over all the\nprotected data, which it may freely examine or modify. When access to the\nprotected data is complete, it releases the monitor lock.\nCondition variables allow code in the monitor to wait for a condition to become\ntrue. Each condition variable is associated with an abstract condition, e.g.\n\"some data has arrived for processing\" or \"over 10 seconds has passed since the\nuser's last keystroke\". When code in the monitor needs to wait for a condition\nto become true, it \"waits\" on the associated condition variable, which releases\nthe lock and waits for the condition to be signaled. If, on the other hand, it\nhas caused one of these conditions to become true, it \"signals\" the condition to\nwake up one waiter, or \"broadcasts\" the condition to wake all of them.\nThe theoretical framework for monitors was laid out by C.A.R.Hoare. Their\npractical usage was later elaborated in a paper on the Mesa operation system.\nCondition variable types and functions are declared in\ninclude/threads/synch.h.\n\nstruct condition;\n\n\nRepresents a condition variable.\n\n\nvoid cond_init (struct condition *cond);\n\n\nInitializes cond as a new condition variable.\n\n\nvoid cond_wait (struct condition *cond, struct lock *lock);\n\n\nAtomically releases lock (the monitor lock) and waits for cond to be signaled\nby some other piece of code. After cond is signaled, reacquires lock before\nreturning. lock must be held before calling this function. Sending a signal\nand waking up from a wait are not an atomic operation. Thus, typically\ncond_wait()'s caller must recheck the condition after the wait completes\nand, if necessary, wait again. See the next section for an example.\n\n\nvoid cond_signal (struct condition *cond, struct lock *lock);\n\n\nIf any threads are waiting on cond (protected by monitor lock lock), then this\nfunction wakes up one of them. If no threads are waiting, returns without\nperforming any action. lock must be held before calling this function.\n\n\nvoid cond_broadcast (struct condition *cond, struct lock *lock);\n\n\nWakes up all threads, if any, waiting on cond (protected by monitor lock\nlock). lock must be held before calling this function.\n\nMonitor Example\nThe classical example of a monitor is handling a buffer into which one or more\n\"producer\" threads write characters and out of which one or more \"consumer\"\nthreads read characters. To implement this we need, besides the monitor lock,\ntwo condition variables which we will call not_full and not_empty:\n    char buf[BUF_SIZE];     /* Buffer. */\n    size_t n = 0;         /* 0 \nNote that BUF_SIZE must divide evenly into SIZE_MAX + 1 for the above code\nto be completely correct. Otherwise, it will fail the first time head wraps\naround to 0. In practice, BUF_SIZE would ordinarily be a power of 2.\nOptimization Barriers\nAn optimization barrier is a special statement that prevents the compiler from\nmaking assumptions about the state of memory across the barrier. The compiler\nwill not reorder reads or writes of variables across the barrier or assume that\na variable's value is unmodified across the barrier, except for local variables\nwhose address is never taken. In Pintos, include/threads/synch.h defines the\nbarrier() macro as an optimization barrier.\nOne reason to use an optimization barrier is when data can change\nasynchronously, without the compiler's knowledge, e.g. by another thread or an\ninterrupt handler. The too_many_loops() function in devices/timer.c is an\nexample. This function starts out by busy-waiting in a loop until a timer tick\noccurs:\n    /* Wait for a timer tick. */\n    int64_t start = ticks;\n    while (ticks == start)\n        barrier();\n\nWithout an optimization barrier in the loop, the compiler could conclude that\nthe loop would never terminate, because start and ticks start out equal and\nthe loop itself never changes them. It could then \"optimize\" the function into\nan infinite loop, which would definitely be undesirable.\nOptimization barriers can be used to avoid other compiler optimizations. The\nbusy_wait() function, also in devices/timer.c, is an example. It contains\nthis loop:\n    while (loops-- > 0)\n      barrier ();\n\nThe goal of this loop is to busy-wait by counting loops down from its original\nvalue to 0. Without the barrier, the compiler could delete the loop entirely,\nbecause it produces no useful output and has no side effects. The barrier forces\nthe compiler to pretend that the loop body has an important effect.\nFinally, optimization barriers can be used to force the ordering of memory reads\nor writes. For example, suppose we add a \"feature\" that, whenever a timer\ninterrupt occurs, the character in global variable timer_put_char is printed\non the console, but only if global Boolean variable timer_do_put is true. The\nbest way to set up x to be printed is then to use an optimization barrier,\nlike this:\n    timer_put_char = 'x';\n    barrier ();\n    timer_do_put = true;\n\nWithout the barrier, the code is buggy because the compiler is free to reorder\noperations when it doesn't see a reason to keep them in the same order. In this\ncase, the compiler doesn't know that the order of assignments is important, so\nits optimizer is permitted to exchange their order. There's no telling whether\nit will actually do this, and it is possible that passing the compiler different\noptimization flags or using a different version of the compiler will produce\ndifferent behavior.\nAnother solution is to disable interrupts around the assignments. This does not\nprevent reordering, but it prevents the interrupt handler from intervening\nbetween the assignments. It also has the extra runtime cost of disabling and\nre-enabling interrupts:\n    enum intr_level old_level = intr_disable ();\n    timer_put_char = 'x';\n    timer_do_put = true;\n    intr_set_level (old_level);\n\nA second solution is to mark the declarations of timer_put_char and\ntimer_do_put as volatile. This keyword tells the compiler that the variables\nare externally observable and restricts its latitude for optimization. However,\nthe semantics of volatile are not well defined, so it is not a good general\nsolution. The base Pintos code does not use volatile at all.\nThe following is not a solution, because locks neither prevent interrupts nor\nprevent the compiler from reordering the code within the region where the lock\nis held:\n    lock_acquire (&timer_lock);        /* INCORRECT CODE */\n    timer_put_char = 'x';\n    timer_do_put = true;\n    lock_release (&timer_lock);\n\nThe compiler treats invocation of any function defined externally, that is, in\nanother source file, as a limited form of optimization barrier. Specifically,\nthe compiler assumes that any externally defined function may access any\nstatically or dynamically allocated data and any local variable whose address is\ntaken. This often means that explicit barriers can be omitted. It is one reason\nthat Pintos contains few explicit barriers.\nA function defined in the same source file, or in a header included by the\nsource file, cannot be relied upon as a optimization barrier. This applies even\nto invocation of a function before its definition, because the compiler may read\nand parse the entire source file before performing optimization.\n"},"appendix/memory_allocation.html":{"url":"appendix/memory_allocation.html","title":"Memory Allocation","keywords":"","body":"Memory Allocation\nPintos contains two memory allocators, one that allocates memory in units of a\npage, and one that can allocate blocks of any size.\nPage Allocator\nThe page allocator declared in include/threads/palloc.h allocates memory\nin units of a page. It is most often used to allocate memory one page at a time,\nbut it can also allocate multiple contiguous pages at once.\nThe page allocator divides the memory it allocates into two pools, called the\nkernel and user pools. By default, each pool gets half of system memory above\n1MB, but the division can be changed with the ul kernel command line option.\nAn allocation request draws from one pool or the other. If one pool becomes\nempty, the other may still have free pages. The user pool should be used for\nallocating memory for user processes and the kernel pool for all other\nallocations. This will only become important starting with project 3. Until\nthen, all allocations should be made from the kernel pool.\nEach pool's usage is tracked with a bitmap, one bit per page in the pool. A\nrequest to allocate n pages scans the bitmap for n consecutive bits set to\nfalse, indicating that those pages are free, and then sets those bits to true to\nmark them as used. This is a \"first fit\" allocation strategy.\nThe page allocator is subject to fragmentation. That is, it may not be possible\nto allocate n contiguous pages even though n or more pages are free, because\nthe free pages are separated by used pages. In fact, in pathological cases it\nmay be impossible to allocate 2 contiguous pages even though half of the pool's\npages are free. Single-page requests can't fail due to fragmentation, so\nrequests for multiple contiguous pages should be limited as much as possible.\nPages may not be allocated from interrupt context, but they may be freed.\nWhen a page is freed, all of its bytes are cleared to 0xcc, as a debugging\naid (see Debugging Tips).\nPage allocator types and functions are described below.\n\nvoid *palloc_get_page (enum palloc_flags flags)\nvoid *palloc_get_multiple (enum palloc_flags flags, size_t page_cnt)\n\n\nObtains and returns one page, or page_cnt contiguous pages, respectively.\nReturns a null pointer if the pages cannot be allocated.\nThe flags argument may be any combination of the following flags:\n\nPAL_ASSERT\n If the pages cannot be allocated, panic the kernel. This is only appropriate\n during kernel initialization. User processes should never be permitted to\n panic the kernel.\n\nPAL_ZERO\n Zero all the bytes in the allocated pages before returning them.\n If not set, the contents of newly allocated pages are unpredictable.\n\nPAL_USER\n Obtain the pages from the user pool. If not set, pages are allocated from\n the kernel pool.\n\n\n\n\nvoid palloc_free_page (void *page)\nvoid palloc_free_multiple (void *pages, size_t page_cnt)\n\n\nFrees one page, or page cnt contiguous pages, respectively, starting at\npages. All of the pages must have been obtained using palloc_get_page()\nor palloc_get_multiple().\n\nBlock Allocator\nThe block allocator, declared in threads/malloc.h, can allocate blocks of any\nsize. It is layered on top of the page allocator described in the previous\nsection. Blocks returned by the block allocator are obtained from the kernel\npool.\nThe block allocator uses two different strategies for allocating memory. The\nfirst strategy applies to blocks that are 1 kB or smaller\n(one-fourth of the page size). These allocations are rounded up to the nearest\npower of 2, or 16 bytes, whichever is larger. Then they are grouped into a page\nused only for allocations of that size.\nThe second strategy applies to blocks larger than 1 kB. These allocations\n(plus a small amount of overhead) are rounded up to the nearest page in size,\nand then the block allocator requests that number of contiguous pages from the\npage allocator.\nIn either case, the difference between the allocation requested size and the\nactual block size is wasted. A real operating system would carefully tune its\nallocator to minimize this waste, but this is unimportant in an instructional\nsystem like Pintos.\nAs long as a page can be obtained from the page allocator, small allocations\nalways succeed. Most small allocations do not require a new page from the page\nallocator at all, because they are satisfied using part of a page already\nallocated. However, large allocations always require calling into the page\nallocator, and any allocation that needs more than one contiguous page can fail\ndue to fragmentation, as already discussed in the previous section. Thus, you\nshould minimize the number of large allocations in your code, especially those\nover approximately 4 kB each.\nWhen a block is freed, all of its bytes are cleared to 0xcc, as a debugging\naid (see Debugging Tips).\nThe block allocator may not be called from interrupt context.\nThe block allocator functions are described below. Their interfaces are the same\nas the standard C library functions of the same names.\n\nvoid *malloc (size_t size)\n\n\nObtains and returns a new block, from the kernel pool, at least size bytes long.\nReturns a null pointer if size is zero or if memory is not available.\n\n\nvoid *calloc (size_t a, size_t b)\n\n\nObtains a returns a new block, from the kernel pool, at least a * b bytes\nlong. The block's contents will be cleared to zeros. Returns a null pointer if\na or b is zero or if insufficient memory is available.\n\n\nvoid *realloc (void *block, size_t new_size)\n\n\nAttempts to resize block to new_size bytes, possibly moving it in the\nprocess. If successful, returns the new block, in which case the old block\nmust no longer be accessed. On failure, returns a null pointer, and the old\nblock remains valid. A call with block null is equivalent to malloc(). A\ncall with new size zero is equivalent to free().\n\n\nvoid free (void *block)\n\n\nFrees block, which must have been previously returned by malloc(),\ncalloc(), or realloc() (and not yet freed).\n\n"},"appendix/virtual_address.html":{"url":"appendix/virtual_address.html","title":"Virtual Address","keywords":"","body":"Virtual Addresses\nA 64-bit virtual addresses are structured as follows:\n63          48 47            39 38            30 29            21 20         12 11         0\n+-------------+----------------+----------------+----------------+-------------+------------+\n| Sign Extend |    Page-Map    | Page-Directory | Page-directory |  Page-Table |  Physical  |\n|             | Level-4 Offset |    Pointer     |     Offset     |   Offset    |   Offset   |\n+-------------+----------------+----------------+----------------+-------------+------------+\n              |                |                |                |             |            |\n              +------- 9 ------+------- 9 ------+------- 9 ------+----- 9 -----+---- 12 ----+\n                                          Virtual Address\nHeader include/threads/vaddr.h, and include/threads/mmu.h define these\nfunctions and macros for working with virtual addresses:\n\n#define PGSHIFT { /* Omit details */ }\n#define PGBITS { /* Omit details */ }\n\n\nThe bit index (0) and number of bits (12) of the offset part of a virtual\naddress, respectively.\n\n\n#define PGMASK { /* Omit details */ }\n\n\nA bit mask with the bits in the page offset set to 1, the rest set to 0\n(0xfff).\n\n\n#define PGSIZE { /* Omit details */ }\n\n\nThe page size in bytes (4,096).\n\n\n#define pg_ofs(va) { /* Omit details */ }\n\n\nExtracts and returns the page offset in virtual address va.\n\n\n#define pg_no(va) { /* Omit details */ }\n\n\nExtracts and returns the page number in virtual address va.\n\n\n#define pg_round_down(va) { /* Omit details */ }\n\n\nReturns the start of the virtual page that va points within, that is, va\nwith the page offset set to 0.\n\n\n#define pg_round_up(va) { /* Omit details */ }\n\n\nReturns va rounded up to the nearest page boundary.\n\nVirtual memory in Pintos is divided into two regions: user virtual memory and\nkernel virtual memory (see Virtual Memory Layout).\nThe boundary between them is KERN_BASE:\n\n#define KERN_BASE { /* Omit details */ }\n\n\nBase address of kernel virtual memory.

The page \ntable in Pintos (which is the one you are going to use in the project)\nis called pml4 for Page-Map-Level-4 by Intel processor documentation because the table has \n4 levels. The page table interface uses a uint64_t * to \nrepresent a page table because this is convenient for accessing their internal\nstructure. The sections below describe the page table interface and internals.\nCreation, Destruction, and Activation\nThese functions create, destroy, and activate page tables. The base Pintos code already\ncalls these functions where necessary, so it should not be necessary to call them yourself.\n\nuint64_t * pml4_create (void);\n\n\nCreates and returns a new page table. The new page table contains Pintos’s normal\nkernel virtual page mappings, but no user virtual mappings.\nReturns a null pointer if memory cannot be obtained.\n\n\nvoid pml4_destroy (uint64_t *pml4);\n\n\nFrees all of the resources held by pml4, including the page table itself and the frames\nthat it maps. It recursively calls pdpe_destroy, pgdir_destory, and pt_destroy to \nfree all resources at all levels of the page table. \n\n\nvoid pml4_activate (uint64 t *pml4)\n\n\nActivates pml4. The active page table is the one used by the CPU to translate memory\nreferences.\n\nInspection and Updates\nThese functions examine or update the mappings from pages to frames encapsulated by a\npage table. They work on both active and inactive page tables (that is, those for running\nand suspended processes), flushing the TLB as necessary.\n\nbool pml4_set_page (uint64_t *pml4, void *upage, void *kpage, bool rw);\n\n\nAdds to pd a mapping from user page upage to the frame identified by kernel virtual\naddress kpage. If rw is true, the page is mapped read/write; otherwise, it is\nmapped read-only. User page upage must not already be mapped in pml4.\nKernel page kpage should be a kernel virtual address obtained from the user pool\nwith palloc_get_page(PAL_USER). Returns true if successful, false on failure. \nFailure will occur if additional memory\nrequired for the page table cannot be obtained.\n\n\nvoid * pml4_get_page (uint64_t *pml4, const void *uaddr);\n\n\nLooks up the frame mapped to uaddr in pml4. Returns the kernel virtual address for\nthat frame, if uaddr is mapped, or a null pointer if it is not.\n\n\nvoid pml4_clear_page (uint64_t *pml4, void *upage);\n\n\nMarks page “not present” in pml4. Later accesses to the page will fault.\nOther bits in the page table for page are preserved, permitting the accessed and dirty\nbits (see the next section) to be checked. This function has no effect if page is not mapped.\n\nAccessed and Dirty Bits\nx86_64 hardware provides some assistance for implementing page replacement algorithms,\nthrough a pair of bits in the page table entry (PTE) for each page. On any read or write to\na page, the CPU sets the accessed bit to 1 in the page’s PTE, and on any write, the CPU\nsets the dirty bit to 1. The CPU never resets these bits to 0, but the OS may do so.\nProper interpretation of these bits requires understanding of aliases, that is, two (or\nmore) pages that refer to the same frame. When an aliased frame is accessed, the accessed\nand dirty bits are updated in only one page table entry (the one for the page used for\naccess). The accessed and dirty bits for the other aliases are not updated.\n\nbool pml4_is_dirty (uint64_t *pml4, const void *vpage);\nbool pml4_is_accessed (uint64_t *pml4, const void *vpage);\n\n\nReturns true if pml4 contains a page table entry for vpage that is marked\ndirty (or accessed). Otherwise, returns false.\n\n\nvoid pml4_set_dirty (uint64_t *pml4, const void *vpage, bool dirty);\nvoid pml4_set_accessed (uint64_t *pml4, const void *vpage, bool accessed);\n\n\nIf pml4 has a page table entry for page, then its dirty (or accessed) bit\nis set to value given.\n\n"},"appendix/debugging_tools.html":{"url":"appendix/debugging_tools.html","title":"Debugging Tools","keywords":"","body":"Debugging Tools\nMany tools lie at your disposal for debugging Pintos. This appendix introduces\nyou to a few of them.\nprintf()\nDon't underestimate the value of printf(). The way printf() is implemented\nin Pintos, you can call it from practically anywhere in the kernel, whether it's\nin a kernel thread or an interrupt handler, almost regardless of what locks are\nheld. printf() is useful for more than just examining data. It can also help\nfigure out when and where something goes wrong, even when the kernel crashes or\npanics without a useful error message. The strategy is to sprinkle calls to\nprintf() with different strings (e.g. \"\", \"\", . . . ) throughout the\npieces of code you suspect are failing. If you don't even see  printed, then\nsomething bad happened before that point, if you see  but not , then\nsomething bad happened between those two points, and so on. Based on what you\nlearn, you can then insert more printf() calls in the new, smaller region of\ncode you suspect. Eventually you can narrow the problem down to a single\nstatement. See Triple Faults,\nfor a related technique.\nASSERT\nAssertions are useful because they can catch problems early, before they'd\notherwise be noticed. Ideally, each function should begin with a set of\nassertions that check its arguments for validity. (Initializers for functions'\nlocal variables are evaluated before assertions are checked, so be careful not\nto assume that an argument is valid in an initializer.) You can also sprinkle\nassertions throughout the body of functions in places where you suspect things\nare likely to go wrong. They are especially useful for checking loop invariants.\nPintos provides the ASSERT macro, defined in , for checking\nassertions.\n#define ASSERT(expression) { /* Omit details */ }\n\nTests the value of expression. If it evaluates to zero (false), the kernel\npanics. The panic message includes the expression that failed, its file and\nline number, and a backtrace, which should help you to find the problem. See\nBacktraces for more information.\nFunction and Parameter Attributes\nThese macros defined in  tell the compiler special attributes of a\nfunction or function parameter. Their expansions are GCC-specific.\n\n#define UNUSED { /* Omit details */ }\n\n\nAppended to a function parameter to tell the compiler that the parameter might\nnot be used within the function. It suppresses the warning that would\notherwise appear.\n\n\n#define NO_RETURN { /* Omit details */ }\n\n\nAppended to a function prototype to tell the compiler that the function never\nreturns. It allows the compiler to fine-tune its warnings and its code\ngeneration.\n\n\n#define NO_INLINE { /* Omit details */ }\n\n\nAppended to a function prototype to tell the compiler to never emit the\nfunction in-line. Occasionally useful to improve the quality of backtraces\n(see below).\n\n\n#define PRINTF_FORMAT(format, first) { /* Omit details */ }\n\n\nAppended to a function prototype to tell the compiler that the function takes\na printf()-like format string as the argument numbered format (starting from\n1) and that the corresponding value arguments start at the argument numbered\nfirst. This lets the compiler tell you if you pass the wrong argument types.\n\nBacktraces\nWhen the kernel panics, it prints a \"backtrace,\" that is, a summary of how your\nprogram got where it is, as a list of addresses inside the functions that were\nrunning at the time of the panic. You can also insert a call to\ndebug_backtrace(), prototyped in , to print a backtrace at any\npoint in your code. debug_backtrace_all(), also declared in ,\nprints backtraces of all threads.\nThe addresses in a backtrace are listed as raw hexadecimal numbers, which are\ndifficult to interpret. We provide a tool called backtrace to translate these\ninto function names and source file line numbers. Give it the name of your\nkernel.o as the first argument and the hexadecimal numbers composing the\nbacktrace (including the 0x prefixes) as the remaining arguments. It outputs\nthe function name and source file line numbers that correspond to each address.\nIf the translated form of a backtrace is garbled, or doesn't make sense (e.g.\nfunction A is listed above function B, but B doesn't call A), then it's a good\nsign that you're corrupting a kernel thread's stack, because the backtrace is\nextracted from the stack. Alternatively, it could be that the kernel.o you\npassed to backtrace is not the same kernel that produced the backtrace.\nSometimes backtraces can be confusing without any corruption. Compiler\noptimizations can cause surprising behavior. When a function has called another\nfunction as its final action (a tail call), the calling function may not appear\nin a backtrace at all. Similarly, when function A calls another function B that\nnever returns, the compiler may optimize such that an unrelated function C\nappears in the backtrace instead of A. Function C is simply the function that\nhappens to be in memory just after A. In the threads project, this is commonly\nseen in backtraces for test failures.\nExample\nHere's an example. Suppose that Pintos printed out this following call stack,\nwhich is taken from an actual Pintos submission for the file system project:\nCall stack: 0x800426eff 0x8004202fb 0x80042dc22 0x80042cf67 0x800422319\n0x80042325a 0x40012c 0x400a96 0x400ac8.\n\nYou would then invoke the backtrace utility like shown below, cutting and\npasting the backtrace information into the command line. This assumes that\nkernel.o is in the current directory. You would of course enter all of the\nfollowing on a single shell command line, even though that would overflow our\nmargins here:\nbacktrace 0x800426eff 0x8004202fb 0x80042dc22 0x80042cf67 0x800422319\n0x80042325a 0x400012c 0x400a96 0x4000ac8\n\nThe backtrace output would then look something like this:\n0x0000000800426eff: debug_panic (lib/debug.c:86)\n0x00000008004202fb: file_seek (filesys/file.c:405)\n0x000000080042dc22: seek (userprog/syscall.c:744)\n0x000000080042cf67: syscall_handler (userprog/syscall.c:444)\n0x0000000800422319: intr_handler (threads/interrupt.c:334)\n0x000000080042325a: intr_entry (threads/intr-stubs.S:38)\n0x000000000040012c: (unknown)\n0x0000000000400a96: (unknown)\n0x0000000000400ac8: (unknown)\n\n(You will probably not see exactly the same addresses if you run the command\nabove on your own kernel binary, because the source code you compiled and the\ncompiler you used are probably different.)\nThe first line in the backtrace refers to debug_panic(), the function that\nimplements kernel panics. Because backtraces commonly result from kernel panics,\ndebug_panic() will often be the first function shown in a backtrace.\nThe second line shows file_seek() as the function that panicked, in this case\nas the result of an assertion failure. In the source code tree used for this\nexample, line 405 of filesys/file.c is the assertion\nASSERT (file_ofs >= 0);\n(This line was also cited in the assertion failure message.) Thus, file_seek()\npanicked because it passed a negative file offset argument.\nThe third line indicates that seek() called file_seek(), presumably without\nvalidating the offset argument. In this submission, seek() implements the seek\nsystem call. The fourth line shows that syscall_handler(), the system call\nhandler, invoked seek(). The fifth and sixth lines are the interrupt handler\nentry path. The remaining lines are for addresses below KERN_BASE. This means\nthat they refer to addresses in the user program, not in the kernel.\nGDB\nYou can run Pintos under the supervision of the GDB debugger. First, start\nPintos with the --gdb option, e.g. pintos --gdb -- run mytest. Second, open\na second terminal on the same machine and use gdb to invoke GDB on 'kernel.o'\ngdb kernel.o\nand issue the following GDB command:\ntarget remote localhost:1234\nNow GDB is connected to the simulator over a local network connection. You can\nnow issue any normal GDB commands. If you issue the 'c' command, the simulated\nBIOS will take control, load Pintos, and then Pintos will run in the usual way.\nYou can pause the process at any point with Ctrl+C.\nUsing GDB\nYou can read the GDB manual by typing info gdb at a terminal command prompt.\nHere's a few commonly useful GDB commands:\n\nc [GDB Command]\n\n\nContinues execution until hCtrl+Ci or the next breakpoint.\n\n\nbreak function [GDB Command]\n\nbreak file:line [GDB Command]\n\nbreak address [GDB Command]\n\n\n\nSets a breakpoint at function, at line within file, or address. (Use a '0x'\nprefix to specify an address in hex.)\nUse break main to make GDB stop when Pintos starts running.\n\n\np expression [GDB Command]\n\n\nEvaluates the given expression and prints its value. If the expression\ncontains a function call, that function will actually be executed.\n\n\nl address [GDB Command]\n\n\nLists a few lines of code around address. (Use a '0x' prefix to specify an\naddress in hex.)\n\n\nbt [GDB Command]\n\n\nPrints a stack backtrace similar to that output by the backtrace program\ndescribed above.\n\n\np/a address [GDB Command]\n\n\nPrints the name of the function or variable that occupies address. (Use a\n'0x' prefix to specify an address in hex.)\n\n\ndiassemble function [GDB Command]\n\n\nDisassembles function.\n\nHere's an extra tip for anyone who read this: install gdb script such as\npwndbg. This makes your life easier!\nFAQ\n\nCan I use GDB inside Emacs?\n\n\nYes, you can. Emacs has special support for running GDB as a subprocess.\nType M-x gdb and enter your pintos-gdb command at the prompt. The Emacs\nmanual has information on how to use its debugging features in a section\ntitled \"Debuggers.\"\n\n\nGDB is doing something weird.\n\n\nIf you notice strange behavior while using GDB, there are three possibilities:\na bug in your modified Pintos, a bug in Bochs's interface to GDB or in GDB\nitself, or a bug in the original Pintos code. The first and second are quite\nlikely, and you should seriously consider both. We hope that the third is less\nlikely, but it is also possible.\n\nTriple Faults\nWhen a CPU exception handler, such as a page fault handler, cannot be invoked\nbecause it is missing or defective, the CPU will try to invoke the \"double\nfault\" handler. If the double fault handler is itself missing or defective,\nthat's called a \"triple fault.\" A triple fault causes an immediate CPU reset.\nThus, if you get yourself into a situation where the machine reboots in a loop,\nthat's probably a \"triple fault.\" In a triple fault situation, you might not be\nable to use printf() for debugging, because the reboots might be happening\neven before everything needed for printf() is initialized.\nThere exists way to debug triple faults.\nPick a place in the Pintos code, insert the infinite loop for (;;); there, and\nrecompile and run. There are two likely possibilities:\n\nThe machine hangs without rebooting. If this happens, you know that the\ninfinite loop is running. That means that whatever caused the reboot must be\nafter the place you inserted the infinite loop. Now move the infinite loop\nlater in the code sequence.\n\nThe machine reboots in a loop. If this happens, you know that the machine\ndidn't make it to the infinite loop. Thus, whatever caused the reboot must be\nbefore the place you inserted the infinite loop. Now move the infinite loop\nearlier in the code sequence.\nIf you move around the infinite loop in a \"binary search\" fashion, you can use\nthis technique to pin down the exact spot that everything goes wrong. It\nshould only take a few minutes at most.\n\n\nTips\nThe page allocator in threads/palloc.c and the block allocator in\nthreads/malloc.c clear all the bytes in memory to '0xcc' at time of free.\nThus, if you see an attempt to dereference a pointer like 0xcccccccc, or some\nother reference to 0xcc, there's a good chance you're trying to reuse a page\nthat's already been freed. Also, byte 0xcc is the CPU opcode for \"invoke\ninterrupt 3,\" so if you see an error like Interrupt 0x03 (#BP Breakpoint\nException), then Pintos tried to execute code in a freed page or block. An\nassertion failure on the expression sec_no capacity indicates that Pintos\ntried to access a file through an inode that has been closed and freed. Freeing\nan inode clears its starting sector number to 0xcccccccc, which is not a valid\nsector number for disks smaller than about 1.6 TB.\n"},"appendix/development_tools.html":{"url":"appendix/development_tools.html","title":"Development Tools","keywords":"","body":"Development Tools\nHere are some tools that you might find useful while developing code.\nTags\nTags are an index to the functions and global variables declared in a program.\nMany editors, including Emacs and vi, can use them.

To use it\nyou will need to include its header file, 'lib/kernel/hash.h', with\n#include . No code provided with Pintos uses the hash table, which\nmeans that you are free to use it as is, modify its implementation for your own\npurposes, or ignore it, as you wish.\nMost implementations of the virtual memory project use a hash table to translate\npages to frames. You may find other uses for hash tables as well.\nData Types\nA hash table is represented by struct hash.\n\nstruct hash;\n\n\nRepresents an entire hash table. The actual members of struct hash are\n\"opaque.\" That is, code that uses a hash table should not access struct hash\nmembers directly, nor should it need to. Instead, use hash table functions\nand macros.\n\nThe hash table operates on elements of type struct hash_elem.\n\nstruct hash_elem;\n\n\nEmbed a struct hash_elem member in the structure you want to include in a\nhash table. Like struct hash, struct hash_elem is opaque. All functions\nfor operating on hash table elements actually take and return pointers to\nstruct hash_elem, not pointers to your hash table's real element type.\n\nYou will often need to obtain a struct hash_elem given a real element of the\nhash table, and vice versa. Given a real element of the hash table, you may use\nthe & operator to obtain a pointer to its struct hash_elem. Use the\nhash_entry() macro to go the other direction.\n\n#define hash_entry (elem, type, member) { /* Omit details */ }\n\n\nReturns a pointer to the structure that elem, a pointer to a\nstruct hash_elem, is embedded within. You must provide type, the name of the\nstructure that elem is inside, and member, the name of the member in type that\nelem points to.\nFor example, suppose h is a struct hash_elem * variable that points to a\nstruct thread member (of type struct hash_elem) named h_elem. Then,\nhash_entry (h, struct thread, h_elem) yields the address of the\nstruct thread that h points within.\n\nEach hash table element must contain a key, that is, data that identifies and\ndistinguishes elements, which must be unique among elements in the hash table.\n(Elements may also contain non-key data that need not be unique.) While an\nelement is in a hash table, its key data must not be changed. Instead, if need\nbe, remove the element from the hash table, modify its key, then reinsert the\nelement.\nFor each hash table, you must write two functions that act on keys: a hash\nfunction and a comparison function. These functions must match the following\nprototypes:\n\ntypedef unsigned hash_hash_func (const struct hash_elem *e, void *aux);\n\n\nReturns a hash of element's data, as a value anywhere in the range of unsigned\nint. The hash of an element should be a pseudo-random function of the\nelement's key. It must not depend on non-key data in the element or on any\nnon-constant data other than the key. Pintos provides the following functions\nas a suitable basis for hash functions.\nunsigned hash_bytes (const void *buf, size t *size)\n\nReturns a hash of the size bytes starting at buf. The implementation is the\ngeneral-purpose Fowler-Noll-Vo hash\n(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fowler_Noll_Vo_hash) for 32-bit words.\n\nunsigned hash_string (const char *s)\n\nReturns a hash of null-terminated string s.\n\nunsigned hash_int (int i)\n\nReturns a hash of integer i.\n\nIf your key is a single piece of data of an appropriate type, it is sensible\nfor your hash function to directly return the output of one of these\nfunctions. For multiple pieces of data, you may wish to combine the output of\nmore than one call to them using, e.g., the '^' (exclusive or) operator.\nFinally, you may entirely ignore these functions and write your own hash\nfunction from scratch, but remember that your goal is to build an operating\nsystem kernel, not to design a hash function. See Section\n[Hash Auxiliary Data], for an explanation of aux.\nbool hash_less_func (const struct hash_elem *a, const struct hash_elem *b,\n                       void *aux)\n\nCompares the keys stored in elements a and b. Returns true if a is less than\nb, false if a is greater than or equal to b.\nIf two elements compare equal, then they must hash to equal values.\n\nSee Section [Hash Auxiliary Data], for an explanation of aux.\nSee Section [Hash Table Example], for hash and comparison function examples.\nA few functions accept a pointer to a third kind of function as an argument:\nvoid hash_action_func (struct hash_elem *element, void *aux)\n\nPerforms some kind of action, chosen by the caller, on element.\nSee Section [Hash Auxiliary Data], for an explanation of aux.\n\n\nBasic Functions\nThese functions create, destroy, and inspect hash tables.\n\nbool hash_init (struct hash *hash, hash_hash_func *hash_func,\n                    hash_less_func *less_func, void *aux)\n\n\nInitializes hash as a hash table with hash func as hash function, less func as\ncomparison function, and aux as auxiliary data. Returns true if successful,\nfalse on failure. hash_init() calls malloc() and fails if memory cannot be\nallocated. See Hash Auxiliary Data, for an explanation of aux, which is\nmost often a null pointer.\n\n\nvoid hash_clear (struct hash *hash, hash_action_func *action)\n\n\nRemoves all the elements from hash, which must have been previously\ninitialized with hash_init().\nIf action is non-null, then it is called once for each element in the hash\ntable, which gives the caller an opportunity to deallocate any memory or other\nresources used by the element. For example, if the hash table elements are\ndynamically allocated using malloc(), then action could free() the\nelement. This is safe because hash_clear() will not access the memory in a\ngiven hash element after calling action on it. However, action must not call\nany function that may modify the hash table, such as hash_insert() or\nhash_delete().\n\n\nvoid hash_destroy (struct hash *hash, hash_action_func *action);\n\n\nIf action is non-null, calls it for each element in the hash, with the same\nsemantics as a call to hash_clear(). Then, frees the memory held by hash.\nAfterward, hash must not be passed to any hash table function, absent an\nintervening call to hash_init().\n\n\nsize_t hash_size (struct hash *hash);\n\n\nReturns the number of elements currently stored in hash.\n\n\nbool hash_empty (struct hash *hash);\n\n\nReturns true if hash currently contains no elements, false if hash contains at\nleast one element.\n\nSearch Functions\nEach of these functions searches a hash table for an element that compares equal\nto one provided. Based on the success of the search, they perform some action,\nsuch as inserting a new element into the hash table, or simply return the result\nof the search.\n\nstruct hash_elem *hash_insert (struct hash *hash, struct hash elem *element);\n\n\nSearches hash for an element equal to element. If none is found, inserts\nelement into hash and returns a null pointer. If the table already contains an\nelement equal to element, it is returned without modifying hash.\n\n\nstruct hash_elem *hash_replace (struct hash *hash, struct hash elem *element);\n\n\nInserts element into hash. Any element equal to element already in hash is removed.\nReturns the element removed, or a null pointer if hash did not contain an element\nequal to element.\nThe caller is responsible for deallocating any resources associated with the returned\nelement, as appropriate. For example, if the hash table elements are dynamically\nallocated using malloc(), then the caller must free() the element after it is no\nlonger needed.\n\nThe element passed to the following functions is only used for hashing and\ncomparison purposes. It is never actually inserted into the hash table. Thus,\nonly key data in the element needs to be initialized, and other data in the\nelement will not be used. It often makes sense to declare an instance of the\nelement type as a local variable, initialize the key data, and then pass the\naddress of its struct hash_elem to hash_find() or hash_delete(). See\nHash Table Example, for an example. (Large\nstructures should not be allocated as local variables. See\nstruct thread, for more information.)\n\nstruct hash_elem *hash_find (struct hash *hash, struct hash elem *element);\n\n\nSearches hash for an element equal to element. Returns the element found,\nif any, or a null pointer otherwise.\n\n\nstruct hash_elem *hash_delete (struct hash *hash, struct hash elem *element);\n\n\nSearches hash for an element equal to element. If one is found, it is removed\nfrom hash and returned. Otherwise, a null pointer is returned and hash is\nunchanged.\nThe caller is responsible for deallocating any resources associated with the\nreturned element, as appropriate. For example, if the hash table elements are\ndynamically allocated using malloc(), then the caller must free() the\nelement after it is no longer needed.\n\nIteration Functions\nThese functions allow iterating through the elements in a hash table. Two\ninterfaces are supplied. The first requires writing and supplying a\nhash_action_func to act on each element.\n\nvoid hash_apply (struct hash *hash, hash action func *action);\n\n\nCalls action once for each element in hash, in arbitrary order. action must\nnot call any function that may modify the hash table, such as hash_insert()\nor hash_delete(). action must not modify key data in elements, although it\nmay modify any other data.\n\nThe second interface is based on an \"iterator\" data type. Idiomatically,\niterators are used as follows:\n\nstruct hash_iterator i;\nhash_first (&i, h);\nwhile (hash_next (&i)) {\n    struct foo *f = hash_entry (hash_cur (&i), struct foo, elem);\n    . . . do something with f . . .\n}\n\n\nstruct hash_iterator;\n\n\nRepresents a position within a hash table. Calling any function that may\nmodify a hash table, such as hash_insert() or hash_delete(), invalidates\nall iterators within that hash table.\nLike struct hash and struct hash_elem, struct hash_elem is opaque.\n\n\nvoid hash_first (struct hash iterator *iterator, struct hash *hash);\n\n\nInitializes iterator to just before the first element in hash.\n\nstruct hash_elem *hash_next (struct hash iterator *iterator);\n\n\nAdvances iterator to the next element in hash, and returns that element.\nReturns a null pointer if no elements remain. After hash_next() returns null\nfor iterator, calling it again yields undefined behavior.\n\n\nstruct hash_elem *hash_cur (struct hash iterator *iterator);\n\n\nReturns the value most recently returned by hash_next() for iterator. Yields\nundefined behavior after hash_first() has been called on iterator but before\nhash_next() has been called for the first time.\n\nHash Table Example\nSuppose you have a structure, called struct page, that you want to put into a\nhash table. First, define struct page to include a struct hash_elem member:\nstruct page {\n    struct hash_elem hash_elem; /* Hash table element. */\n    void *addr; /* Virtual address. */\n    /* . . . other members. . . */\n};\n\nWe write a hash function and a comparison function using addr as the key. A\npointer can be hashed based on its bytes, and the  operator works fine for\ncomparing pointers:\n/* Returns a hash value for page p. */\nunsigned\npage_hash (const struct hash_elem *p_, void *aux UNUSED) {\n  const struct page *p = hash_entry (p_, struct page, hash_elem);\n  return hash_bytes (&p->addr, sizeof p->addr);\n}\n\n/* Returns true if page a precedes page b. */\nbool\npage_less (const struct hash_elem *a_,\n           const struct hash_elem *b_, void *aux UNUSED) {\n  const struct page *a = hash_entry (a_, struct page, hash_elem);\n  const struct page *b = hash_entry (b_, struct page, hash_elem);\n\n  return a->addr addr;\n}\n\n(The use of UNUSED in these functions' prototypes suppresses a warning that\naux is unused. See Function and Parameter Attributes, for information\nabout UNUSED. See Hash Auxiliary Data, for an explanation of aux.)\nThen, we can create a hash table like this:\nstruct hash pages;\nhash_init (&pages, page_hash, page_less, NULL);\n\nNow we can manipulate the hash table we've created. If p is a pointer to a\nstruct page, we can insert it into the hash table with:\nhash_insert (&pages, &p->hash_elem);\n\nIf there's a chance that pages might already contain a page with the same addr,\nthen we should check hash_insert()'s return value.\nTo search for an element in the hash table, use hash_find(). This takes a\nlittle setup, because hash_find() takes an element to compare against. Here's\na function that will find and return a page based on a virtual address, assuming\nthat pages is defined at file scope:\n/* Returns the page containing the given virtual address, or a null pointer if no such page exists. */\nstruct page *\npage_lookup (const void *address) {\n  struct page p;\n  struct hash_elem *e;\n\n  p.addr = address;\n  e = hash_find (&pages, &p.hash_elem);\n  return e != NULL ? hash_entry (e, struct page, hash_elem) : NULL;\n}\n\nstruct page is allocated as a local variable here on the assumption that it is\nfairly small. Large structures should not be allocated as local variables.\nA similar function could delete a page by address using hash_delete().\nAuxiliary Data\nIn simple cases like the example above, there's no need for the aux parameters.\nIn these cases, just pass a null pointer to hash_init() for aux and ignore the\nvalues passed to the hash function and comparison functions. (You'll get a\ncompiler warning if you don't use the aux parameter, but you can turn that off\nwith the UNUSED macro, as shown in the example, or you can just ignore it.)\naux is useful when you have some property of the data in the hash table is\nboth constant and needed for hashing or comparison, but not stored in the data\nitems themselves. For example, if the items in a hash table are fixed-length\nstrings, but the items themselves don't indicate what that fixed length is, you\ncould pass the length as an aux parameter.\nSynchronization\nThe hash table does not do any internal synchronization. It is the caller's\nresponsibility to synchronize calls to hash table functions. In general, any\nnumber of functions that examine but do not modify the hash table, such as\nhash_find() or hash_next(), may execute simultaneously. However, these\nfunction cannot safely execute at the same time as any function that may modify\na given hash table, such as hash_insert() or hash_delete(), nor may more\nthan one function that can modify a given hash table execute safely at once.\nIt is also the caller's responsibility to synchronize access to data in hash\ntable elements. How to synchronize access to this data depends on how it is\ndesigned and organized, as with any other data structure.\n"}}}
